Long gouges had been dug into the earth, a testament to massive weapons of war and their awe inducing power. Trees had been stripped completely bare of everything save their bark, a result of chaotic magical energies that yet still swirled in the air. Pockets of flame guttered here and there, feeding off of long charred grass and other foliage. Remnants of buildings dotted the landscape spasmodically, some flickering with flames, others reduced to naught but rubble. The sky was a sickly color, an unholy orange combination that was the result of the sun and the moon sharing the sky at the same time; neither refused to lower for the other. The cold twinkling of stars could also be seen in the acidic atmosphere, silent observers to the massive struggles that had occurred below.\r\n\r\n\tAnd among it all, Princess Luna yet stood proud, unwavering. Her foe, consumed by madness and hatred, had proven more resilient than originally anticipated. She had hoped, before all of this had began, that she would have been able to end this chaos before it spread to her ponies. Naturally, that never happened, and the end result was the war torn nation around her. Ponies on both sides had fought and died, father and son, mother and daughter. On one side, those still completely loyal to her and the true Equestrian Crown. On the other side, those loyal to the usurper\xe2\x80\xa6 Corona Flare. Both had paid the cost of war twice over, and at this point in time Luna would be thankful for this to end any time within the next several years.\r\n\r\n\tThe beating of tired wings behind her heralded the arrival of another pony to the scene. Princess Luna knew, before she even turned around, who the mare was. No other pony felt like this one did, and as Luna glanced to her right her instincts were confirmed. Her Valkyrie and a fellow ruler had once more made it to her side, and as Luna turned to the other mare she felt her heart clench. How the other pony was still standing was a mystery to the dark princess. The once proud armor was badly damaged, restricting movement and breathing, if the harsh whistling was anything to go by. The front lower chest of it was crushed inward, and there were perforations along the rest of the suit that trailed dried blood. Above the caved in section, the torc built into the armor still gleamed with bright power. The other princess\xe2\x80\x99 weapon had long since been lost in the desperate struggle, undoubtedly for good. For long moments both princesses stood there, one armored from head to hoof, the other protected by the lightest armor she could forge and a few wards. Finally, Luna spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou look pretty bad, Valkyrie. You should have a medic look at you, just in case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNay. My alicorn magic has already healed the worst of the wounds, and it would take a blacksmith of considerable skill to pry this blasted armor off of me. We simply do not have the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna faced south again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not. Are you sure this plan of yours will work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more powerful than she, despite her recent connection. She won\xe2\x80\x99t even be able to break the spell when I begin its casting. Once it is complete, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rebuild our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about you? How am I supposed to rebuild as the sole ruler of Equestria?  I need you, need you here to help me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.\r\n\r\n\tThe other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them. The once pristine white coat was now blood scarlet, as though it had been reforged in the deepest depths of the sun. The magnificent pastel mane resembled flames from the pits of Tartarus, blinding orange and yellow and burning anything it neared. Oddly enough, the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s cutie mark never changed, merely had its colors inverted to fit the new scheme. And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.\r\n\r\n\tThe answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately? If I am a monster, what does that make you, the vaunted \xe2\x80\x98defender of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me a better pony than you. I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You will answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the audacity to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.\r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion. The armored pony stood her ground, setting her shoulder. Corona slammed into the alicorn, and was thrown back as still active wards flared to life. She came on again, horn lowered, intending to gore on the spot. The Valkyrie parried, lifting a hoof up casually to knock aside the deadly point. As Corona whirled once more, she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing I did\xe2\x80\xa6 was for Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d And she came on again, thundering towards her opponent once more.\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie grabbed ahold of Corona\xe2\x80\x99s head in a vice grip and tossed the rampaging daymare over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou failed Equestria! You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tCorona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed me!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tIt was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAt these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just knew she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we're all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.  The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.  It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.\r\n\r\n\tAs Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.\r\n\r\n\tSoon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.\r\n\r\n\tNext, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.\r\n\r\n\tWith a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.\r\n\r\n", 'chapter_number': 1, 'parent_chapter_id': 320259, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Chapter 1 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The world was a battlefield.</p><p class="indented double">There was no contesting that simple fact, and nothing else could even come close to describing the raw destruction. Long gouges had been dug into the earth, a testament to massive weapons of war and their awe inducing power. Trees had been stripped completely bare of everything save their bark, a result of chaotic magical energies that yet still swirled in the air. Pockets of flame guttered here and there, feeding off of long charred grass and other foliage. Remnants of buildings dotted the landscape spasmodically, some flickering with flames, others reduced to naught but rubble. The sky was a sickly color, an unholy orange combination that was the result of the sun and the moon sharing the sky at the same time; neither refused to lower for the other. The cold twinkling of stars could also be seen in the acidic atmosphere, silent observers to the massive struggles that had occurred below.</p><p class="indented double">And among it all, Princess Luna yet stood proud, unwavering. Her foe, consumed by madness and hatred, had proven more resilient than originally anticipated. She had hoped, before all of this had began, that she would have been able to end this chaos before it spread to her ponies. Naturally, that never happened, and the end result was the war torn nation around her. Ponies on both sides had fought and died, father and son, mother and daughter. On one side, those still completely loyal to her and the true Equestrian Crown. On the other side, those loyal to the usurper\xe2\x80\xa6 Corona Flare. Both had paid the cost of war twice over, and at this point in time Luna would be thankful for this to end any time within the next several years.</p><p class="indented double">The beating of tired wings behind her heralded the arrival of another pony to the scene. Princess Luna knew, before she even turned around, who the mare was. No other pony felt like this one did, and as Luna glanced to her right her instincts were confirmed. Her Valkyrie and a fellow ruler had once more made it to her side, and as Luna turned to the other mare she felt her heart clench. How the other pony was still standing was a mystery to the dark princess. The once proud armor was badly damaged, restricting movement and breathing, if the harsh whistling was anything to go by. The front lower chest of it was crushed inward, and there were perforations along the rest of the suit that trailed dried blood. Above the caved in section, the torc built into the armor still gleamed with bright power. The other princess\xe2\x80\x99 weapon had long since been lost in the desperate struggle, undoubtedly for good. For long moments both princesses stood there, one armored from head to hoof, the other protected by the lightest armor she could forge and a few wards. Finally, Luna spoke.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou look pretty bad, Valkyrie. You should have a medic look at you, just in case.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNay. My alicorn magic has already healed the worst of the wounds, and it would take a blacksmith of considerable skill to pry this blasted armor off of me. We simply do not have the time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna faced south again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not. Are you sure this plan of yours will work?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more powerful than she, despite her recent connection. She won\xe2\x80\x99t even be able to break the spell when I begin its casting. Once it is complete, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rebuild our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about <i>you</i>? How am I supposed to rebuild as the sole ruler of Equestria?&nbsp;&nbsp;I need you, need you here to help me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.</p><p class="indented double">The other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them. The once pristine white coat was now blood scarlet, as though it had been reforged in the deepest depths of the sun. The magnificent pastel mane resembled flames from the pits of Tartarus, blinding orange and yellow and burning anything it neared. Oddly enough, the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s cutie mark never changed, merely had its colors inverted to fit the new scheme. And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.</p><p class="indented double">The answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately? If I am a monster, what does that make you, the vaunted \xe2\x80\x98defender of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me a better pony than you. I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You <i>will</i> answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the <i>audacity</i> to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.</p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion. The armored pony stood her ground, setting her shoulder. Corona slammed into the alicorn, and was thrown back as still active wards flared to life. She came on again, horn lowered, intending to gore on the spot. The Valkyrie parried, lifting a hoof up casually to knock aside the deadly point. As Corona whirled once more, she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing I did\xe2\x80\xa6 was for Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d And she came on again, thundering towards her opponent once more.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie grabbed ahold of Corona\xe2\x80\x99s head in a vice grip and tossed the rampaging daymare over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou failed Equestria! You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Corona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed <i>me</i>!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">It was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">At these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center>\t</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just <i>knew</i> she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we&#039;re all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.</p><p class="indented double">As Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Soon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.</p><p class="indented double">Next, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.</p><p class="indented double">With a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 320259, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E01BB0>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Chapter 1 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The world was a battlefield.</p><p class="indented double">There was no contesting that simple fact, and nothing else could even come close to describing the raw destruction.

You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.</p><p class="indented double">The other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them. The once pristine white coat was now blood scarlet, as though it had been reforged in the deepest depths of the sun. The magnificent pastel mane resembled flames from the pits of Tartarus, blinding orange and yellow and burning anything it neared. Oddly enough, the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s cutie mark never changed, merely had its colors inverted to fit the new scheme. And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.</p><p class="indented double">The answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately? If I am a monster, what does that make you, the vaunted \xe2\x80\x98defender of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me a better pony than you. I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You <i>will</i> answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the <i>audacity</i> to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.</p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion. The armored pony stood her ground, setting her shoulder. Corona slammed into the alicorn, and was thrown back as still active wards flared to life. She came on again, horn lowered, intending to gore on the spot. The Valkyrie parried, lifting a hoof up casually to knock aside the deadly point. As Corona whirled once more, she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing I did\xe2\x80\xa6 was for Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d And she came on again, thundering towards her opponent once more.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie grabbed ahold of Corona\xe2\x80\x99s head in a vice grip and tossed the rampaging daymare over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou failed Equestria! You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Corona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed <i>me</i>!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">It was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">At these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center>\t</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just <i>knew</i> she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we&#039;re all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.</p><p class="indented double">As Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Soon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.</p><p class="indented double">Next, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.</p><p class="indented double">With a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ["//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 1 (*)// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tThe world was a battlefield.\r\n\r\n\tThere was no contesting that simple fact, and nothing else could even come close to describing the raw destruction. Long gouges had been dug into the earth, a testament to massive weapons of war and their awe inducing power. Trees had been stripped completely bare of everything save their bark, a result of chaotic magical energies that yet still swirled in the air. Pockets of flame guttered here and there, feeding off of long charred grass and other foliage. Remnants of buildings dotted the landscape spasmodically, some flickering with flames, others reduced to naught but rubble. The sky was a sickly color, an unholy orange combination that was the result of the sun and the moon sharing the sky at the same time; neither refused to lower for the other. The cold twinkling of stars could also be seen in the acidic atmosphere, silent observers to the massive struggles that had occurred below.\r\n\r\n\tAnd among it all, Princess Luna yet stood proud, unwavering. Her foe, consumed by madness and hatred, had proven more resilient than originally anticipated. She had hoped, before all of this had began, that she would have been able to end this chaos before it spread to her ponies. Naturally, that never happened, and the end result was the war torn nation around her. Ponies on both sides had fought and died, father and son, mother and daughter. On one side, those still completely loyal to her and the true Equestrian Crown. On the other side, those loyal to the usurper\xe2\x80\xa6 Corona Flare. Both had paid the cost of war twice over, and at this point in time Luna would be thankful for this to end any time within the next several years.\r\n\r\n\tThe beating of tired wings behind her heralded the arrival of another pony to the scene. Princess Luna knew, before she even turned around, who the mare was. No other pony felt like this one did, and as Luna glanced to her right her instincts were confirmed. Her Valkyrie and a fellow ruler had once more made it to her side, and as Luna turned to the other mare she felt her heart clench. How the other pony was still standing was a mystery to the dark princess. The once proud armor was badly damaged, restricting movement and breathing, if the harsh whistling was anything to go by. The front lower chest of it was crushed inward, and there were perforations along the rest of the suit that trailed dried blood. Above the caved in section, the torc built into the armor still gleamed with bright power. The other princess\xe2\x80\x99 weapon had long since been lost in the desperate struggle, undoubtedly for good. For long moments both princesses stood there, one armored from head to hoof, the other protected by the lightest armor she could forge and a few wards. Finally, Luna spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou look pretty bad, Valkyrie. You should have a medic look at you, just in case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNay. My alicorn magic has already healed the worst of the wounds, and it would take a blacksmith of considerable skill to pry this blasted armor off of me. We simply do not have the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna faced south again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not. Are you sure this plan of yours will work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more powerful than she, despite her recent connection. She won\xe2\x80\x99t even be able to break the spell when I begin its casting. Once it is complete, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rebuild our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about you? How am I supposed to rebuild as the sole ruler of Equestria?  I need you, need you here to help me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.\r\n\r\n\tThe other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them.

And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.\r\n\r\n\tThe answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately?

I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You will answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the audacity to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.\r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion.

You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tCorona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed me!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tIt was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAt these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just knew she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we're all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.  The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.  It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.\r\n\r\n\tAs Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.\r\n\r\n\tSoon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.\r\n\r\n\tNext, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.\r\n\r\n\tWith a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.\r\n\r\n", 1, 320259, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Chapter 1 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The world was a battlefield.</p><p class="indented double">There was no contesting that simple fact, and nothing else could even come close to describing the raw destruction. Long gouges had been dug into the earth, a testament to massive weapons of war and their awe inducing power. Trees had been stripped completely bare of everything save their bark, a result of chaotic magical energies that yet still swirled in the air. Pockets of flame guttered here and there, feeding off of long charred grass and other foliage. Remnants of buildings dotted the landscape spasmodically, some flickering with flames, others reduced to naught but rubble. The sky was a sickly color, an unholy orange combination that was the result of the sun and the moon sharing the sky at the same time; neither refused to lower for the other. The cold twinkling of stars could also be seen in the acidic atmosphere, silent observers to the massive struggles that had occurred below.</p><p class="indented double">And among it all, Princess Luna yet stood proud, unwavering. Her foe, consumed by madness and hatred, had proven more resilient than originally anticipated. She had hoped, before all of this had began, that she would have been able to end this chaos before it spread to her ponies. Naturally, that never happened, and the end result was the war torn nation around her. Ponies on both sides had fought and died, father and son, mother and daughter. On one side, those still completely loyal to her and the true Equestrian Crown. On the other side, those loyal to the usurper\xe2\x80\xa6 Corona Flare. Both had paid the cost of war twice over, and at this point in time Luna would be thankful for this to end any time within the next several years.</p><p class="indented double">The beating of tired wings behind her heralded the arrival of another pony to the scene. Princess Luna knew, before she even turned around, who the mare was. No other pony felt like this one did, and as Luna glanced to her right her instincts were confirmed. Her Valkyrie and a fellow ruler had once more made it to her side, and as Luna turned to the other mare she felt her heart clench. How the other pony was still standing was a mystery to the dark princess. The once proud armor was badly damaged, restricting movement and breathing, if the harsh whistling was anything to go by. The front lower chest of it was crushed inward, and there were perforations along the rest of the suit that trailed dried blood. Above the caved in section, the torc built into the armor still gleamed with bright power. The other princess\xe2\x80\x99 weapon had long since been lost in the desperate struggle, undoubtedly for good. For long moments both princesses stood there, one armored from head to hoof, the other protected by the lightest armor she could forge and a few wards. Finally, Luna spoke.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou look pretty bad, Valkyrie. You should have a medic look at you, just in case.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNay. My alicorn magic has already healed the worst of the wounds, and it would take a blacksmith of considerable skill to pry this blasted armor off of me. We simply do not have the time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna faced south again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not. Are you sure this plan of yours will work?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more powerful than she, despite her recent connection. She won\xe2\x80\x99t even be able to break the spell when I begin its casting. Once it is complete, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rebuild our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about <i>you</i>? How am I supposed to rebuild as the sole ruler of Equestria?&nbsp;&nbsp;I need you, need you here to help me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.</p><p class="indented double">The other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them. The once pristine white coat was now blood scarlet, as though it had been reforged in the deepest depths of the sun. The magnificent pastel mane resembled flames from the pits of Tartarus, blinding orange and yellow and burning anything it neared. Oddly enough, the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s cutie mark never changed, merely had its colors inverted to fit the new scheme. And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.</p><p class="indented double">The answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately? If I am a monster, what does that make you, the vaunted \xe2\x80\x98defender of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me a better pony than you. I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You <i>will</i> answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the <i>audacity</i> to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.</p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion. The armored pony stood her ground, setting her shoulder. Corona slammed into the alicorn, and was thrown back as still active wards flared to life. She came on again, horn lowered, intending to gore on the spot. The Valkyrie parried, lifting a hoof up casually to knock aside the deadly point. As Corona whirled once more, she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing I did\xe2\x80\xa6 was for Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d And she came on again, thundering towards her opponent once more.</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie grabbed ahold of Corona\xe2\x80\x99s head in a vice grip and tossed the rampaging daymare over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou failed Equestria! You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Corona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed <i>me</i>!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">Corona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">It was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">At these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center>\t</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just <i>knew</i> she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we&#039;re all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.</p><p class="indented double">As Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Soon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.</p><p class="indented double">Next, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.</p><p class="indented double">With a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': "//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 1 (*)// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tThe world was a battlefield.\r\n\r\n\tThere was no contesting that simple fact, and nothing else could even come close to describing the raw destruction. Long gouges had been dug into the earth, a testament to massive weapons of war and their awe inducing power. Trees had been stripped completely bare of everything save their bark, a result of chaotic magical energies that yet still swirled in the air. Pockets of flame guttered here and there, feeding off of long charred grass and other foliage. Remnants of buildings dotted the landscape spasmodically, some flickering with flames, others reduced to naught but rubble. The sky was a sickly color, an unholy orange combination that was the result of the sun and the moon sharing the sky at the same time; neither refused to lower for the other. The cold twinkling of stars could also be seen in the acidic atmosphere, silent observers to the massive struggles that had occurred below.\r\n\r\n\tAnd among it all, Princess Luna yet stood proud, unwavering. Her foe, consumed by madness and hatred, had proven more resilient than originally anticipated. She had hoped, before all of this had began, that she would have been able to end this chaos before it spread to her ponies. Naturally, that never happened, and the end result was the war torn nation around her. Ponies on both sides had fought and died, father and son, mother and daughter. On one side, those still completely loyal to her and the true Equestrian Crown. On the other side, those loyal to the usurper\xe2\x80\xa6 Corona Flare. Both had paid the cost of war twice over, and at this point in time Luna would be thankful for this to end any time within the next several years.\r\n\r\n\tThe beating of tired wings behind her heralded the arrival of another pony to the scene. Princess Luna knew, before she even turned around, who the mare was. No other pony felt like this one did, and as Luna glanced to her right her instincts were confirmed. Her Valkyrie and a fellow ruler had once more made it to her side, and as Luna turned to the other mare she felt her heart clench. How the other pony was still standing was a mystery to the dark princess. The once proud armor was badly damaged, restricting movement and breathing, if the harsh whistling was anything to go by. The front lower chest of it was crushed inward, and there were perforations along the rest of the suit that trailed dried blood. Above the caved in section, the torc built into the armor still gleamed with bright power. The other princess\xe2\x80\x99 weapon had long since been lost in the desperate struggle, undoubtedly for good. For long moments both princesses stood there, one armored from head to hoof, the other protected by the lightest armor she could forge and a few wards. Finally, Luna spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou look pretty bad, Valkyrie. You should have a medic look at you, just in case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNay. My alicorn magic has already healed the worst of the wounds, and it would take a blacksmith of considerable skill to pry this blasted armor off of me. We simply do not have the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna faced south again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not. Are you sure this plan of yours will work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more powerful than she, despite her recent connection. She won\xe2\x80\x99t even be able to break the spell when I begin its casting. Once it is complete, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to rebuild our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about you? How am I supposed to rebuild as the sole ruler of Equestria?  I need you, need you here to help me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave me here alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a despairing note.\r\n\r\n\tThe other princess nuzzled up beneath Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chin, giving the mare a quick kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cI can and I will, Luna. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to stop her. It may not seem like much, but I can give you time to rebuild. Time to gather your strength for her eventual return, for not even my power can hold her for eternity. And I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone forever, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how Harmony works. The world needs its defenders, and I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return eventually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pouted.\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie was about to reply before she was interrupted by more wingbeats. There was a blinding flare of light, and then there she was. Corona Flare. The same maniacal pony they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for the past who knew how long. The pony they had once viewed as a friend, as an equal. Even gazing upon her now, neither princess could detect a trace of Celestia within the hellish creature opposite them. The once pristine white coat was now blood scarlet, as though it had been reforged in the deepest depths of the sun. The magnificent pastel mane resembled flames from the pits of Tartarus, blinding orange and yellow and burning anything it neared. Oddly enough, the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s cutie mark never changed, merely had its colors inverted to fit the new scheme. And lastly, the legendary armor of the Princess of the Sun had changed, encompassing vital areas while leaving the legs and underbelly bare. Flare stalked forward a few paces, fangs bared.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat is far enough, monster.\xe2\x80\x9d The Valkyrie spoke firmly. Just for a moment, the slight wheezing was gone.\r\n\r\n\tThe answer was a resounding cackle that seemed to rebound off the very air. \xe2\x80\x9cMe? A monster? Have you looked at yourself lately? If I am a monster, what does that make you, the vaunted \xe2\x80\x98defender of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me a better pony than you. I am willing to do what is necessary to preserve our species.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why I tossed you about like a rag doll, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly surprised you yet live. I was positive I had killed you in that last battle. But no matter. I can just do it now, and have it over with.\xe2\x80\x9d Flare inched forward again, but paused when the ring of magic rent the air.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will no longer harm the ponies we swore to protect, Tia. I forbid it. You will answer for your crimes. You have harmed thousands. You slaughtered my closest friend, your own wife. And then you have the audacity to refuse to lower the sun, to turn our land into a barren nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic began to once more permeate the atmosphere as the Valkyrie prepared her spell. Princess Luna found herself taking several steps back; Despite the fact that the demented pony before them was her sister, right now this was not her fight any more.\r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s only response was to charge the other princess with a cry of rage, aiming to stop the spell from reaching completion. The armored pony stood her ground, setting her shoulder. Corona slammed into the alicorn, and was thrown back as still active wards flared to life. She came on again, horn lowered, intending to gore on the spot. The Valkyrie parried, lifting a hoof up casually to knock aside the deadly point. As Corona whirled once more, she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing I did\xe2\x80\xa6 was for Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d And she came on again, thundering towards her opponent once more.\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie grabbed ahold of Corona\xe2\x80\x99s head in a vice grip and tossed the rampaging daymare over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou failed Equestria! You forsake the promises we swore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tCorona fired a blast from her horn, catching the Valkyrie in the shoulder and causing the mare to stumble as her wards fizzled. The daymare pounced upon this opportunity, ramming a shod hoof against her foe\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. She then pressed her advantage, raining blow after blow onto the head. She punctuated each attack with words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave Magic to me! Me! And then you left me! Said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, then left me with so much power! You forsook Equestria, and left me to pick up your pieces! If anything, you failed me!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tCorona\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared, then proceeded to toss the Valkyrie away. She crashed through a building. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never had the strength of a true princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe other alicorn picked her way out of the ruined structure, limping. The wheezing was back, louder than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not rely on strength alone, Celestia. My power is all around you. Just begging to be used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tIt was then that the daymare discovered her mistake. Throughout the entire fight, the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s horn had never ceased its glow. Now it grew to blinding proportions, causing even Corona to falter. When the daymare went to take a step back, however, she discovered she was trapped inside a dome. Stone rose up around the traitor, crushing her in a grip she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to escape. Her horn flashed dangerously, trying to dispell the magic. Nothing worked. Desperate to have the last word, she spoke in a sibilant hiss. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Valkyrie stared at her enemy coldly, before stepping into the sphere of magic. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. You chose your own destiny. As have I. Your sentence is hereby thus: You are banished into the deepest pits of the celestial body you control for a thousand years. You will stay there, and come to terms with all that you have done. And to ensure your sentence will be carried out, I hereby sacrifice my own mortal shell to chain you to your prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAt these final words, a beam of light suddenly fell from the heavens, vaporizing everything inside the bubble. When the glow died, nothing remained save the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s armor, and nothing could be heard aside from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s keening cry of anguish.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Twilight. At least try to eat something. Tomorrow is an important day for all of us, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass out from hunger on such a big day!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie, outrageously pink with the puffiest mane and tail imaginable, jabbed a hoof at Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s thus far untouched plate. Twilight tried to return her smile, but found that her lips just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t form the simple movement. Twilight glanced down at the food set before her, picking at pieces of it with her magenta tinged magic. The plate was pile high with her favorite foods: Stacks of hayfries, a daisy sunflower sandwich, and several greens and fruits besides. Tonight, however, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply fall upon her food like she had in the past.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s words rang true. Tomorrow would decide the future for Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the Canterlot Orphans. Tomorrow was Career Day, and would determine exactly what\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94future Equestria had in store for her. Deep, deep down inside, the purple unicorn just knew she was being silly. From levitation to teleportation to complex spell casting, Twilight had studied them all and only wanted more. There was no way that Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns would turn her down. She would become a mage, one of the powerful defenders of Equestria, ready to serve the Crown in times of need. She was yanked from her daydreams by another voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh think she\xe2\x80\x99s just nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack tossed down her fork and tipped her faithful Stetson forward, shading her emerald eyes a bit. Nothing made Applejack happier than to be outside in the heat of the Sun, tending apple trees and farming equipment. Twilight knew that Applejack was going to head directly into the Equestrian Rangers; an elite group of soldiers who farmed for a living, but acted as a defensive buffer to the Crown. With muscles like Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, the mare would be suited for little else. \xe2\x80\x9cNerves are a dreadful thing, Twi. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let em distract ya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight protested, twirling a fork in her magic. She realized as she did so that this was a mistake.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash glanced up from her own loaded plate, a comment already formed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Twilight is nervous! After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare that spends all of her time studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Sleek and smooth, Rainbow Dash was Wonderbolt material.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we're all nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy peeked her head out from behind her soft pink mane and offered a rare smile to Twilight, which the unicorn managed to return this time. Fluttershy lived up to her name, almost scared of her own shadow and too shy to make friends outside of her fellow Orphans. Her trusty first aid kit rested at the end of their table, within easy reach. As far as Twilight knew, Fluttershy never went anywhere without it.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d Pinkie Pie proclaimed exuberantly. Twilight arched an eyebrow at her, which caused the bouncy mare to giggle. Pinkie Pie would almost certainly gravitate towards Equestria Intelligence. With a knack for baking or cooking, Pinkie already had the perfect alias to her name. Pinkie reached out an impossibly long hoof, almost as long as she was tall, and scooped up a doughnut from the platter of a passing waiter. She then proceeded to shove the entire thing into her mouth and swallow it whole.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed slightly, struggling to take her mind off tomorrow, and tried to become more active with her fellow Canterlot Orphans.  The Canterlot Orphans were just that: orphan fillies and colts whose parents had died in service to the Crown. Her Royal Highness Princess Luna raised these foals as Children of Canterlot, offering them a place to stay and giving them a small stipend from the Treasury. A vast majority of the Orphans were taken in by other Canterlot nobles\xe2\x80\x94with the recent exception being Twilight Sparkle. As young as she was, the aspiring mage knew exactly why, too: Freifrau Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle was one of the last living descendants of one of the most important and influential Houses. As such, other nobility only saw her as a marriage contract that would allow them to gain more peerage. After turning her third foster family into a trio of toads, Princess Luna herself deigned to give Twilena living space within Canterlot. Twilight mentally shuddered. She hated her real name, much preferring the informal Twilight Sparkle.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her attempt to ward off thoughts of her slight predicament, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind stubbornly refused to let it go. It was hard, being one of the last lines of one of the only Houses devoted purely to the Crown. It was even harder because she was a mare. Among other nobility in Canterlot, it was expected that Twilight Sparkle marry into some other House and raise foals. That should be her sole purpose, and nothing more. Twilight, however, had other plans. Being officially recognized by the Crown as a Canterlot Orphan, Twilight could participate in Career Day if she so chose. Once she turned seventeen, Twilight had a decision to make: She could both fold to the wishes of other nobility and find some stuffy old snob to marry, or she could find her own place in the world.  It was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s every intention to do the latter. Career Day would provide that opportunity. When tomorrow comes, so too will the Masters of various branches of Equestria services. Should a Master Mage decide to accept Twilight Sparkle as an apprentice, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to fully leave the plotting of other nobles behind. It would be tough going for a while, but doable. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least two years of learning at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns, then another two years of study under her Master. After that, if her Master deems her competent enough, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out on her own, patrolling Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s borders and keeping an eye on their enemies.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stood up from her still untouched plate suddenly. Ignoring the questions of the other Orphans, Twilight exited the palace kitchens and meandered down a random hallway. She knew her friends were only trying to help comfort her (maybe with the exception of Rainbow), but at the moment Twilight did not want their condolences. Maybe Rainbow was right after all, as loath as Twilight wanted to admit it. The reclusive unicorn spent so much of her time locked away studying, it was a wonder any Master would even look twice at her. She could barely even classify her fellow Orphans as actual friends. The general defense against the schemes attempted to be woven around her was to usually lock herself away with her books. Doing so also helped hide the fact that she was still a Blank Flank.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of still not having her cutie mark caused Twilight to glance longingly back at her bare flanks. Canterlot Orphans almost never received their cutie marks until after Career Day, meaning they were usually the oldest ponies to never have one. As such, this lead to a lot of ridicule from much younger colts and fillies who already knew what they were going to do with their life. So yes, locking herself away in her own personal tower with her books was often a good idea. At least the books would not laugh at her. Twilight scowled slightly, kicking at the marble floor with a forehoof. She did not want to go back and attempt to eat, or to be surrounded by her Orphan-mates. Even her books did not beckon to her like they normally did. Unable to decide what to do now or even what she wanted to do, Twilight headed for the one place she could always find peace and quiet.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Gardens were like a second home to Twilight, coming only after her books and the library. The gardens were so vast, Twilight had several places she could go for total solitude, away from other ponies. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves rang out on cobblestone as she stepped through the archway leading into the main lobby of the palace. The two pegasus guards stationed at either side nodded respectfully at the Orphan as she walked sedately past, heading directly to the Gardens off to one side. As Twilight passed the boundary into the Gardens proper, she let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Her tense form relaxed, and her breathing came easier. It was always like this in the Gardens. The smell of various plants. The soothing shade of towering trees, blotting out the moonlight. The soft symphony of insects providing a pleasant background noise. Even the occasional wild rabbit or bird helped create a potent mix that struck a calming chord deep within Twilight. She often came here when plagued by thoughts of the past and future, and every time this magical place put her at ease.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight immediately took a right, headed off to an obscure corner of the garden. Right now, she only sought peace and quiet. She did not want to think, or to make small talk, or anything. She just wanted to sit and do absolutely nothing but breathe in the crisp atmosphere around her. Twilight trotted right up to a small stone bench overshadowed by towering oaks. A slight outline that was whiter than the rest of the stone, matching her body when curled up, was a testament to how often the young unicorn came to this very bench. She clambered up onto the coolness and curled up, matching the indentation perfectly. She closed her eyes and just lay there, still as the rock she rested on. She barely even moved as she breathed. Even if somepony walked right by her, they would only see her if she moved or they tried to sit on her.\r\n\r\n\tAs Twilight lay there, in a state halfway between sleep and awareness, the lights in Canterlot Palace started to extinguish. One by one the many windows in the palace went out. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s ear flicked as she heard Pinkie Pie calling her name in the distance, but Twilight ignored the call. Eventually, there was only one light left shining in the palace, high above her. She could see it with her magical sight, and knew that it belonged to Princess Luna, ruler of Equestria. Undoubtedly the Monarch was still awake, poring over papers and other important documents. The Princess often stayed up late, taking care of business so that she could continue to run Equestria as smoothly as possible.\r\n\r\n\tSoon, however, even the light in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chamber went out as the Royal prepared for some sleep before reawakening to brighten the moon, signalling the start of a new night. Still, Twilight Sparkle remained on her bench, uncaring and unthinking. Slowly but surely, the gifted unicorn began to expand her consciousness outward. When she had first began training herself in turning her mind into a corporeal form, Twilight had barely managed to expand a few feet from her body. Practicing again and again allowed the purple mare to expand a little farther each time. Now, she could extend her consciousness well past the garden boundaries, and drape it across all of Canterlot Palace. She could feel almost everything like this. The bright pinpricks of her fellow Orphans were the easiest to pick out, as she spent a good deal of her time with them, whenever she was not studying. Each were currently in their rooms, wrapped in easy slumber. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips curved into a smile as she gently caressed each of them in turn. Despite what she told herself, Twilight had really come to care for the other Orphans... Even Rainbow Dash, as brash and cocky as she was.\r\n\r\n\tNext, Twilight sought out the familiar spark that was her brother. Captain Shining Armor was an orphan too, but not recognized as such by the Crown any more. He joined the Guard on his Career day, and has since risen up through the ranks of the Canterlot Guard with unmatched determination and devotion. Thanks to Shining\xe2\x80\x99s own ceaseless duties and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s studying, the siblings have not had much time to visit each other often. Twilight missed her brother dearly. He was the only family she had left, and fully supported his younger sister in her quest to be an independent mare. On several occasions Shining had personally offered to step in and take care of a particularly nasty noble. However, thanks to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s reclusiveness to ponies who were not fellow Orphans, Shining never really had to do much more than flex his military muscles.\r\n\r\n\tWith a small sigh of exertion, Twilight finally returned to her body. She clambered to her hooves, wincing at the slight cramps from remaining still for so long. In roughly seven hours she would be standing before the Masters, who would determine her future. Quickly and quietly, Twilight fled back to her tower, still struggling to keep her mind off the future and what it would hold. The young mare collapsed upon her bed with a grunt, where sleep finally took a hold of her tired mind.\r\n\r\n", 'epub': None}

It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up. With a slight grumble, she swung her hooves off the side of her bed and dropped to the floor with a gentle clack. She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.\r\n\r\n\tA purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.\r\n\r\n\tStepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot. Ready to go find something to eat, Twilight exited and locked her personal quarters before moving down the hallway at a steady trot. While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.\r\n\r\n\tThe halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.\r\n\r\n\tFinally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn\'t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.\r\n\r\n\tSlowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?\r\n\r\n\tLike she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master would want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.\r\n\r\n\tThe door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.\r\n\r\n\tNext, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.\r\n\r\n\tIt took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.\r\n\r\n\tDry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tApplejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight\'s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\'s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWithout pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:  \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tHot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?"\r\n\r\n\tTwilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\nThe first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tThe wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing "Princess" all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to ask Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThere was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did.

Her slight trepidation colored her tone.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come.

It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up. With a slight grumble, she swung her hooves off the side of her bed and dropped to the floor with a gentle clack. She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.</p><p class="indented double">A purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.</p><p class="indented double">Stepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot. Ready to go find something to eat, Twilight exited and locked her personal quarters before moving down the hallway at a steady trot. While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.</p><p class="indented double">The halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.</p><p class="indented double">Finally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn&#039;t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. <i>After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?</i></p><p class="indented double">Like she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master <i>would</i> want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.</p><p class="indented double">The door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.</p><p class="indented double">Next, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.</p><p class="indented double">It took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.</p><p class="indented double">Dry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight&#039;s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p> Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Without pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Hot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?&quot;</p><p class="indented double">Twilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. <i>Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9</i>. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Walking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="double">The first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">The wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis <i>is</i> a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing &quot;Princess&quot; all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to <i>ask</i> Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">There was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did. As my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, you will learn to tap into each and every branch of magic. From Friendship, to Necromancy, you will learn them all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight stuttered. Her slight trepidation colored her tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come. Let us grab some luncheon and prepare for your studies.&quot;</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 320603, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E01CD0>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'2\'></a><h3>Chapter 2 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'></p><p class="indented double">\tThe next evening came windy yet warm, and the beams of moonlight gently caressed Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping visage. It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up.

She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.</p><p class="indented double">A purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.</p><p class="indented double">Stepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot.

While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.</p><p class="indented double">The halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.</p><p class="indented double">Finally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn&#039;t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. <i>After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?</i></p><p class="indented double">Like she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master <i>would</i> want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.</p><p class="indented double">The door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.</p><p class="indented double">Next, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.</p><p class="indented double">It took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.</p><p class="indented double">Dry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight&#039;s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p> Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Without pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Hot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?&quot;</p><p class="indented double">Twilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. <i>Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9</i>. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Walking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="double">The first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">The wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis <i>is</i> a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing &quot;Princess&quot; all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to <i>ask</i> Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">There was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did. As my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, you will learn to tap into each and every branch of magic. From Friendship, to Necromancy, you will learn them all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight stuttered. Her slight trepidation colored her tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come. Let us grab some luncheon and prepare for your studies.&quot;</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 2 (*)// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\tThe next evening came windy yet warm, and the beams of moonlight gently caressed Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping visage. It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up. With a slight grumble, she swung her hooves off the side of her bed and dropped to the floor with a gentle clack. She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.\r\n\r\n\tA purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.\r\n\r\n\tStepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot. Ready to go find something to eat, Twilight exited and locked her personal quarters before moving down the hallway at a steady trot. While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.\r\n\r\n\tThe halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.\r\n\r\n\tFinally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn\'t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.\r\n\r\n\tSlowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?\r\n\r\n\tLike she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master would want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.\r\n\r\n\tThe door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.\r\n\r\n\tNext, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.\r\n\r\n\tIt took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.\r\n\r\n\tDry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tApplejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight\'s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\'s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWithout pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:  \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tHot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?"\r\n\r\n\tTwilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\nThe first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tThe wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing "Princess" all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to ask Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThere was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did. As my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, you will learn to tap into each and every branch of magic. From Friendship, to Necromancy, you will learn them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight stuttered. Her slight trepidation colored her tone.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come. Let us grab some luncheon and prepare for your studies."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 2, 320603, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'2\'></a><h3>Chapter 2 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'></p><p class="indented double">\tThe next evening came windy yet warm, and the beams of moonlight gently caressed Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping visage. It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up. With a slight grumble, she swung her hooves off the side of her bed and dropped to the floor with a gentle clack. She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.</p><p class="indented double">A purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.</p><p class="indented double">Stepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot. Ready to go find something to eat, Twilight exited and locked her personal quarters before moving down the hallway at a steady trot. While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.</p><p class="indented double">The halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.</p><p class="indented double">Finally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn&#039;t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. <i>After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?</i></p><p class="indented double">Like she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master <i>would</i> want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.</p><p class="indented double">The door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.</p><p class="indented double">Next, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.</p><p class="indented double">It took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.</p><p class="indented double">Dry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight&#039;s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p> Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Without pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Hot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?&quot;</p><p class="indented double">Twilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. <i>Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9</i>. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Walking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="double">The first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="indented double">The wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis <i>is</i> a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing &quot;Princess&quot; all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to <i>ask</i> Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">There was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did. As my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, you will learn to tap into each and every branch of magic. From Friendship, to Necromancy, you will learn them all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight stuttered. Her slight trepidation colored her tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come. Let us grab some luncheon and prepare for your studies.&quot;</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 2 (*)// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\tThe next evening came windy yet warm, and the beams of moonlight gently caressed Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping visage. It took several moments for the slumbering unicorn to react to the bright intrusion upon her eyelids; while Twilight prided herself on being an intelligent and quick witted pony, it still took a while for her mind to wake itself up. With a slight grumble, she swung her hooves off the side of her bed and dropped to the floor with a gentle clack. She stretched all four legs in sequence, starting with her front right and ending with her back left. She then arched her back and stretched like a cat as she waited for her body to finish rousing itself. Then, satisfied that her night was off to a pretty decent start, Twilight darted into the bathroom to freshen up a bit.\r\n\r\n\tA purple flash from her horn simultaneously turned on the lights and turned the shower water to just the right temperature. After locking the door behind her, the mare gleefully leapt into the soothing warm spray, thankful as always for modern plumbing. For several long moments she stood there, letting the water hammer upon her back and the heat soak into her fur. Even though it was the start of summer, nothing ever felt as good as a nice warm shower. Finally deciding that she had been standing there long enough, Twilight then proceeded to quickly scrub herself. The sooner she could finish her evening routine the sooner she could find some breakfast before Career Night officially started. No matter what else happened, skipping breakfast was simply out of the question. She had tried that, once. It had left her almost completely nonfunctional the entire night. Slipping the long bristle brush back onto its holder, Twilight shut off the water and directed a concentrated wave of heat to dry out her coat.\r\n\r\n\tStepping over to the sink, the unicorn levitated a brush up to her mane and gently tamed the unruly mess. Her bed mane had always been atrocious, and tonight was no different. Satisfied that her mane was once more ruler straight below her horn, she tugged the brush through her tail a few times. Her work done, the brush soared back over to its hook as Twilight unlocked and exited the bathroom. She immediately approached her well worn saddlebags, where she stood a moment, considering. She very much doubted that she would need any books or supplies for her Choosing, but at the same time, she never went anywhere without a couple of books and some stationary. Shrugging slightly, the saddlebags lifted up in a magenta glow and settled smoothly onto their customary spot. Ready to go find something to eat, Twilight exited and locked her personal quarters before moving down the hallway at a steady trot. While thievery was uncommon in the palace itself, it had long been decided that one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any chances.\r\n\r\n\tThe halls of Canterlot Palace were empty this early in the evening, as per usual; Most ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up until much later in the night. With the exception of servants going about their business, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other soul until she reached her first intersection of corridors. Here, Twilight met a pair of Royal Guards casually standing at the north and south entrances. They nodded at Twilight, a nod she returned as she moved down the west hallway. A couple more corridors branched off the one she was following, more Royal Guards stationed at each. Eventually, however, she reached her destination: The Mess Hall. There was only one other occupant in the room, a white unicorn stallion with a blue mane and moustache with a reading monocle over his left eye. He glanced up from his newspaper as Twilight entered, and then promptly waved genially. Twilight returned the greeting, a half smile on her lips. Fancy Pants and his wife, Prench Ambassador Fleur Dis Lee were outstanding ponies, and one of the few nobles Twilight could even stand to be around, let alone have a conversation with. Fancy was the current head of the influential merchant House Keymane, second only to House Twinkle. While other nobles had tried everything in their power to add Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own House to theirs, Fancy and his kin had supported the last of the Twinkle line. Before Princess Luna had given her permission to live within the palace, Twilight had considered asking Fancy if he would be willing to foster her until she turned of age.\r\n\r\n\tFinally listening to her stomach\xe2\x80\x99s growling demands, the unicorn entered one of the four empty food lines, grasping a tray in her levitation and presenting it to the unicorn cook behind the counter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe usual for me this evening, Sparks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe cook nodded and dashed away. Normally the counter would be laden with all sorts of breakfast items, but this early in the evening most food wasn\'t even done being prepared yet. Canterlot Palace had an odd habit of running like clockwork, and judging by the moonlight streaming in through the tall windows, Twilight had a good fifteen minutes to eat in peace before other ponies began to arrive. Returning her attention to the cook, Twilight took her tray with a small thanks and moved towards her usual table. Settling down with an appreciative sniff, the lavender mare lifted a fork and dug into her fluffy eggs. A small bite of toast and a swallow of orange juice followed before Twilight slowed her pace and casually glanced around. Fancy was still immersed in his newspaper, a cup of coffee now accompanying him. It was odd to not see Fleur around anywhere, but it was likely that she was already well into her daily schedule.\r\n\r\n\tSlowly but surely, more ponies began trickling in. These were the average pony, the ones that kept the palace and the Inner City working smoothly. Carpenters, masons, artists, all sorts of trades lived within the palace itself; most of them held some sort of favor with Princess Luna, while others had bought their way into the palace apartments. Unsurprisingly, there were no other nobles among them. Fancy was the only one who preferred to breakfast with the average citizen; it was usually a profitable move, as it gave House Keymane\xe2\x80\x99s assets easy access to the head of house. Even as Twilight watched, a few ponies she recognized moved to converse with the stallion. Slurping up the last little bit of her juice, Twilight took her empty glass and tray over to one of the bins and placed them within the properly labeled areas. Then, as more equines started to arrive, the unicorn made a hasty exit.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight now waited alone in the small chamber where Career Night would commence. None of the other Orphans had even gotten their own first meal of the evening finished yet, but Twilight did not mind the solitude. She was not sure she could stomach the sight of her fellow Orphans already knowing where they would belong. Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words from the night before once more returned to her mind, taunting her and laughing silently. After all, who is going to want a unicorn mare who spends all of her time studying?\r\n\r\n\tLike she has in the past, Twilight struggled to just let Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99s words slide off her consciousness. The future Wonderbolt was impulsive and spoke without thinking, but Twilight knew that the cyan flier didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything by it. Even despite knowing this, it was hard to just ignore what Dash had said. What Master would want her? Sure, she studied a lot, and probably knew more about most types of magic than other mages out there. But she never had any intention of just choosing one branch of magic and making that her course of study. She wanted to learn them all. She wanted to master them all. And no mage in their right mind would allow Twilight Sparkle to expand her knowledge outside what the Master taught. The best she could hope for was to at least be accepted into Luna\xe2\x80\x99s School for Gifted Unicorns and go from there.\r\n\r\n\tThe door in front of her swung open slowly, and in marched the other four Orphans. One by one, they took their seats to either side of Twilight, offering small smiles or words of encouragement to the lavender unicorn. At the end of the procession marched Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Dry Parchment. It would be he who called in the Masters for this Career Night; Princess Luna was undoubtedly busy with other matters, and would not attend. Dry Parchment gave the gathered Orphans a cursory glance, and then proceeded to yet another door to the right of the one he had entered from. Through this door appeared various Masters, all dressed differently and of differing ages and coloration.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, Orphans. Line up and let the Masters get a good look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d Dry Parchment\xe2\x80\x99s voice matched his namesake, hoarse and cracking. One by one, Twilight and her friends rose and shuffled into a rough four pony line, facing the impassive Masters before them. They automatically lined up in age, from oldest to youngest; while the Orphans were all seventeen now, there were still differences in when they had been born. Applejack was first, being several months older than her Orphan-mates. Pinkie Pie was next, followed by Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and then Twilight at the very end, who had just turned seventeen yesternight. The air of the room was tense, expectant, and charged with almost visible electricity.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight eyed the Masters, taking in their various appearances. She recognized most of them, having actually grown up in the castle proper. The first in the group of Masters was some noble named Silver Bit. He was a unicorn, which was kind of odd seeing as he was the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Rangers. How he had gotten a position at the head of a bunch of earth pony farmers Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; Silver Bit was thin and small, with none of the impressive muscles one might expect. As his name suggested, his coat and mane were silver, with shifty, watery eyes and a trio of bits as his cutie mark. He sniffed slightly as he stared at the Orphans, his mouth curling into a disdainful frown.\r\n\r\n\tNext, standing loosely next to Silver Bit, was the flaming Spitfire, Captain of the Wonderbolts. The fiery pegasus was every bit as sleek and smooth as Rainbow Dash, and looked coolly out of place in her signature Wonderbolt flight uniform. Spitfire wore tinted glasses, distantly detached from the proceedings. Twilight felt her respect for the flier rise a bit. After Spitfire was Zecora, head of Equestrian Intelligence. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the zebra Zecora was the only foreign Master seen in hundreds of years. With several ankle rings and piercings, coupled with a careless Mohawk, Zecora would be the last creature you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see at the head of a vast spy network. But her wit was as sharp as her eyes, and the zebra missed nothing. She had eyes and ears everywhere. Then lastly, there was Shimmer, the lead doctor of the Medic Corps. The pegasus was dressed in a loose white lab coat that clashed magnificently with her maroon coat coloration. A stethoscope draped around her neck completed the classic doctor look.\r\n\r\n\tIt took Twilight a few moments of studying the masters to realize that there were no Mages among them. Her heart rate quickened considerably as she studied the Masters before her, and her mouth felt as dry as a desert. There were several she did not recognize, from less important positions, but, without a doubt, there were no Mages to be seen. Sweat started to bead upon her brow, and her eyes darted repeatedly to the exits. Rainbow Dash was right. Not even the lowest of Mages wanted her as an apprentice. She started to hyperventilate, and almost missed what Dry Parchment was now saying. Rainbow Dash glanced over at the unicorn briefly, and nudged her comfortingly. The cyan flier had noticed the same thing, but it would not do for Twilight to completely lose her head. Twilight calmed herself down enough to pay attention.\r\n\r\n\tDry Parchment was motioning Applejack forward impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now. Step forward, Orphan. State your name and preference, and we shall see if the Masters have a spot open for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tApplejack hesitated a bit, eyeing Silver Bit hesitantly. She lifted a hoof and took a half step forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m Applejack, Ah\xe2\x80\x99d like to head tah the Equestrian Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilver Bit barely glanced at Applejack before nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got space for her.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was as watery as his eyes. Silver Bit turned to leave, clearly expecting Applejack to follow. The earth pony mare did, casting a slight frown at the back of her new superior.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cJerk,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire muttered, barely audible. A smile twitched at the corner of Twilight\'s lips. Spitfire then promptly turned her attention to Rainbow Dash, who was next in line and starting to inch forward. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAccepted, Cadet,\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said, before Dash even had a chance to state her name. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you in the Wonderbolt Mess Hall bright and early tomorrow. Am I understood, Cadet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash snapped off a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might make a good Wonderbolt yet. Dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Rainbow Dash proceeded out the main doorway. Spitfire turned and promptly launched herself out the large, open window. Fluttershy tripped forward next, hiding behind her long pink mane.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cM-my name is Fluttershy,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled, her voice even further muffled by her hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apply for Medic Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d Fluttershy cringed slightly at the end of her statement, clenching her pale eyes. Shimmer stepped forward softly, taking care not to startle the shy mare.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor hummed, studying Fluttershy carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the mark of a Whisperer in you, child, as well as your willingness to help those in need. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go far in the Corps. Come, Fluttershy. Let us get you settled in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\'s eyes shot open to see Shimmer watching her with an encouraging smile. With a small smile of her own, Fluttershy began to follow Shimmer out of the room, leaving Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle behind. Pinkie Pie bounced forward already introducing herself. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Zecora! I\xe2\x80\x99m Pinkamena Diane Pie, but everyone calls me Pinkie Pie! The Equestrian Intelligence is right up my alley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Zebra raised an eyebrow as Pinkie suddenly stopped hopping and appeared in Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s Mohawk, looking upside down into the mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pinkie Pie, it appears that you do have a knack for surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you under my wing, little one, and see how well you do with my network of spies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWithout pausing a beat, Pinkie leapt out of Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s mane and began bouncing out the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOki doki Loki,\xe2\x80\x9d the pink mare sang. Zecora followed the little pink ball of energy out of the door, which closed with a booming finality.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight Sparkle was left alone with a hoof-full of Masters she did not recognize. Her heart sank as she confirmed that not a single Master still in the room was a Mage. Still, the unicorn resolutely stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice with a barely restrained quaver:  \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Twilight Sparkle. And, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find a Mage Master\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tHot tears began to well up in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the reality of it hit her. There was no Mage here willing to take her under their guidance. It looked like Twilight had two choices now; she could choose a blacksmith or storeowner to become an apprentice to, or she could settle down with some grimy stallion from another noble House. If she were honest with herself, number two was starting to sound like the best choice. At least she\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to read and study a small bit of magic. Before she could open her mouth again, a new voice interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI shall account for this little one,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Twilight went rigid in shock, as did Dry Parchment and the remaining Masters. She turned around so quickly she almost lost her balance and fell over. There, emerging from a hidden servant doorway, was Princess Luna. The Equestrian Princess looked oddly comfortable, her silver regalia shining in the light of the mideveing moon. A small smile was tugging at the edges of her mouth as every pony present immediately dropped into a bow. Twilight Sparkle did the same, slightly later than everypony else. The Princess of the Night approached the young mare and laid a gentle hoof upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Twilight Sparkle. So, will you accept? Will you become my personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9?"\r\n\r\n\tTwilight heard all of the words, but her mind stuck at one particular part. That simple word bounced ceaselessly inside her head. Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Princess Luna wanted to be Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teacher. Princess Luna, the pony responsible for raising both the sun and the moon, wanted to become Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. Twilight slowly stood up, her face pale and clammy. Her breathing was harsh and ragged, sounding over loud in the sudden silence. After a few seconds of stunned silence, Twilight finally found her voice again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would be honored, Princess, but I do not feel that I deserve such an honor as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, posh, Twilight Sparkle. I have watched you since you first appeared as an Orphan. I have seen you ceaselessly studying; devouring books that even more advanced magicians would have troubles with. You are gifted, Twilight Sparkle, and I would help you learn to control your powers. Now, come, my new apprentice. We have much ground to cover in just tonight alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalking in a daze, Twilight Sparkle tripped after her new mentor, out the door and down yet another hallway.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\nThe first thing Twilight was assaulted with as she stepped into Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study was a wall of pristine white and a high, yet familiar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, darling! It has simply been too long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve last seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\tThe wall of white detached itself from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision and formed itself into Rarity, another unicorn a year older than Twilight and the other Orphans. Rarity had once been an Orphan just like Twilight and the others, but, being a year older, the white unicorn had partook in Career Night just last year. Twilight had always wondered where her other acquaintance had been accepted into; judging by the looks of things, Princess Luna had chosen Rarity as an apprentice as well.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a surprise, Rarity! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you since your Career Night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI know, darling! But Princess Luna wanted me to be kept a secret, so she could surprise you when she chose you as her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. I think she thought having a familiar face around might help you with your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that had been my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Luna stepped fully into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise that I shall let the two of you catch up later, but at the moment, I need to assess Twilight and determine how I should go about instructing her. Rarity, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the rest of the night off of your studies? I believe that some congratulations are in order for your other friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a un-lady like squeal, Rarity bounded out the door. Princess Luna closed it with a tendril of black magic. The Princess then turned to the still semi stunned Twilight Sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have scared you like that, Twilight Sparkle. I expressly forbid any Mage Masters showing up for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Career Night. I wanted you all to myself, without interference from other mages or nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s answer was automatic, her voice distant.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna scowled sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Twilight, just call me Luna. I do not like hearing "Princess" all the time. First of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with some basics. How familiar are you with the different branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight considered her question carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Princ\xe2\x80\x94Luna. There are ten different areas of magic. To my knowledge, the most common is the magic of Friendship. This branch is also the least studied, as Friendship usually manifests on its own. A good group of friends can often overcome any odds. After that, there is both the Light, and the Night. Light magic is simply there. Any magician can harness and use it, so long as they have the willpower. Night magic is a little different. You have to ask Night for its power, and usually have to give it something in return. Even a brief glimpse into the thoughts of a Night caster is enough to meet most requirements. Nature magic is often confused with the Light. Nature focuses on life and wellbeing, whereas Light gives strength and courage. Then there is also Love. Love is often tricky to handle, as it requires a user to be\xe2\x80\xa6 intimate\xe2\x80\xa6 and sexually active with another. These five together are often known as Accord Magic.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe other five are known as Discord Magic. Animosity is probably the most common, and is practically the polar opposite of Friendship. Animosity can drive a caster to greater lengths to achieve his or her goal, without the help of others. After that comes Destruction, and Hatred. Destruction is just that, purely destructive. I have read that Destruction is designed solely to obliterate, using a casters inner disquiet. Hatred usually only comes to casters of sharp mind, and it also acts slowly with more precision. The last two are the fields that are the least studied, requiring recommendations from the most important ponies in Equestria before they can be studied. The less foul of the two is Chaos. This branch is unruly, uncivilized. It does not care who uses it or for what purpose, so long as it causes plenty of problems, big or small. The very last area of magic is\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy. Nopony has studied Necromancy for years and years. The dead are more unpredictable that Chaos, and the dead should remain so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThere was a small silence after Twilight finished. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, warmth coloring her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few could name them as accurately as you just did. As my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, you will learn to tap into each and every branch of magic. From Friendship, to Necromancy, you will learn them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight stuttered. Her slight trepidation colored her tone.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all. Do not worry so, Twilight. I will be here to teach you, and to guide you. Even Necromancy is not nearly so terrible when taught by one who knows what they are doing. Now, come. Let us grab some luncheon and prepare for your studies."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'epub': None}

At first, Twilight had wanted to question why on Equestria Princess Luna had a small kitchenette in her study of all places. Then Twilight reminded herself that Luna was a Princess, and therefore could have a kitchen anywhere she chose to. After that, Twilight became distracted just watching Luna. The Alicorn moved about the appliances with gentle grace, never once hurrying as she chopped some greens for a simple salad and sliced some fresh turkey meat for sandwiches. The latter was what Twilight was really looking forward to; Meat was quite rare in Equestria, as they could never grow it fast enough to feed an entire nation. Meat was usually reserved for special occasions like Hearth\xe2\x80\x99s Warming Eve, and the rest of the time the ponies of Equestria made due with enhanced fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It took Twilight a few moments to realize that she was no longer just watching the Princess work. Time and again Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were drawn to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly natural beauty. Princess Luna was only a stretch or two taller than Twilight, but the Princess still had legs that gave the impression of being miles long. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of the Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: Military Equestria and Basic Guide to Magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with Military Equestria and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.\r\n\r\nEquestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Rangers \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil. This branch of the military acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cnational guard\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts, mobilizing in the event Equestria becomes invaded. In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wonderbolts \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave. Ancient pegasi magic combined with aerial moves introduced by the iconic Commander Hurricane has given the Bolts a reputation well deserved. Undying loyalty to the Crown they serve and to each other leaves the Wonderbolts as Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s oldest military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that was what Rainbow Dash was getting herself into. It sounded like the Wonderbolts strived to be the very best, all the time. It seemed rather unrealistic to Twilight, and the studious mare wondered if Dash would be up to the challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medic Corps \xe2\x80\x93The Medic Corps have been around as long as the Wonderbolts. Comprised of animal Whisperers and the best doctors Equestria can provide, the Corps is the singular force that keeps Equestria breathing. From combating sickness in Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s many cities and towns, to practicing their art upon the field of battle, the Corps provide the muscle behind recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, that certainly sounded right up Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s alley, if she could get over her intense shyness. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any other pony that would care so much for a complete stranger.\r\n\r\n\t Canterlot Guard --The Canterlot Guard is one of the last lines of defense for the Equestrian Crown. They mainly police the palace and the grounds itself, although it has been known for Canterlot Guards to sign contracts with other nobility.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was what Shining Armor was, a Canterlot Guard. Nothing made her brother happier than to be defending the Princess.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Intelligence  \xe2\x80\x93EI knows everything. A vast spy network comprised of undercover agents everywhere, Equestrian Intelligence ensures the nation they serve is prepared for anything. Every major plan, every notable event usually revolves around an EI combat agent. They operate from the shadows, usually shaping Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s future more than any other military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equestrian Intelligence had Pinkie Pie written all over it. That pony knew things about other ponies she had no business knowing about. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was a thought never spoken aloud. Pinkie Pie would still know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arcane Brigade \xe2\x80\x93If there is one thing the enemies of Equestria fear, it is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Arcane Brigade. Comprised of the most deadly spell casters ever born, the Brigade only enters a conflict when the need is dire. The Brigade guards their magical secrets jealously, ensuring that enemies know next to nothing about them. The Brigade is also responsible for Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s advancements with magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arcane Brigade. The name sent pleasing shivers down Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s spine. She had always dreamed that she would have a chance to join the Brigade, after learning all she could from a Master Mage. The Brigade solved everything, and Twilight would love nothing more than to be that part of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s forces. Perhaps Luna would allow her to join the Brigade after Twilight completed her training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Valkyrie \xe2\x80\x93If the Arcane Brigade brings fear to Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, then Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Valkyrie brings unbridled terror. Throughout Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s history, the Valkyrie has been a mare every bit as powerful as Princess Luna herself. Records show that victory is guaranteed when the Valkyrie takes to the battlefield. Mastering every branch of magic known to Sol, the Valkyrie is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s right hoof, meting out justice where she sees fit. The other branches of military also directly answer to the Valkyrie, rather than Princess Luna. \r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This  was a name that brought back foalhood memories. Everypony knew who the Valkyrie had been. Respected, feared, and loved as much as the Princess herself, the last Valkyrie vanished sometime during the giant War almost a thousand years ago. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, there has not been one since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Princess Luna  \xe2\x80\x93There has only been one instance where the Princess of Equestria has entered combat personally. This was back during the War of the Sun and Moon decades ago, when the usurper Corona Flare attempted to claim the throne of Equestria. The details of this war are vague at best, but it is a testament of Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s prowess that Corona Flare is no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight remembered reading vague details about this war. All anypony remembered was that Corona Flare attempted to usurp Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s position, to bring about never-ending day. After a vicious war, Princess Luna emerged victorious, and supposedly banished Flare into the Sun. At the time, Twilight had thought the tale was simply something to entertain young foals. After seeing Princess Luna up close, and feeling  her majestic power, Twilight was starting to think that perhaps there was a grain of truth to this story. With a thoughtful expression, Twilight opened the second text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magical Basics\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magic is a part of everything. From the visible and flashy magic of unicorns and other casters, to the more subtle passive magic of ground and fliers, magic is everywhere. Over the years, magic has branched out into ten different categories, each with their own counterpart. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There have been numerous disputes when categorizing magic as we know it. For example, a good many scholars and mages feel that Light and Night should be their own counterparts and that a new Accord Magic should be created for Destruction. However, this idea is not entirely sound and has been thus far ignored; Light magic focuses on strength, courage, and  creating new things, while Destruction does the exact opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight knew all of this already. But Princess Luna undoubtedly had some reason to bring this to the forefront of the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Twilight was interrupted from her thoughts by the reappearance of Luna, who had a strange gleam in her eye.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGood, you are finished reading! Now, let us set you up with some chores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cChores?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight echoed, confused. This was not what she had expected when Luna had said there she was going to teach Twilight magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYes, chores. Take a look around, Twilight. Are there any servants here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was confusion layered her voice, but she did have a small inkling of where this was going.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is not! Servants rarely ever approach my study and its hallway; it is the one place they are forbidden from!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This made sense. Twilight had noticed a distinct lack of servants on her walk here, despite the haze over her mind at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cSo then I am going to perform the cleaning they are unable to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Try as she might, Twilight could not hide the disappointment coloring her words.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna finally had mercy on her student. \xe2\x80\x9cRelax, Twilight. You are not in trouble. This is my way of gauging your magical aptitude. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything overly fancy to accomplish what I ask of you. All you should need to do is some levitation and a few other minor spells. I want to test your control and see how you go about completing everynight tasks. Firstly, I would like you to clean up after our lunch. After that, the fireplace needs cleaning out and the mantle dusted. The rugs need to be dirt free. Then you can start on my bookshelves. Dust them and clean them. Make sure my books are all categorized. Once you are finished, then I can get a better idea of where to start you in your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight perked up a bit. Housework was nothing new to her, despite being of noble birth; growing up in the palace instead of a foster home meant she had to clean her own room on numerous occasions. The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started. Horn shimmering with a low key magenta glow, she attacked the stuff left over from lunch. A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit. She then produced a small duster and proceeded to buff the mantle. By that time she had finished the lunch mess and moved onto the books and bookshelves.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna watched her student with interest. She was using and maintaining spells constantly, without conscious effort. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn didn\xe2\x80\x99t even shine any brighter than it had at first, signaling a record low power usage despite all the magic the unicorn was using. It was starting to look like taking Twilight as her personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 was a very good decision. As Luna watched her student, her eyes started to wander. Twilight was young, certainly, but no less an appealing mare. Her legs were sturdy and strong, a testimony to an active pony despite Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s love for books. The fact that Twilight was not some fat, lazy scholar was a very good thing, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s book. While Twilight was nowhere near as glossy and graceful as Luna, there was a certain symphony about her movements, as the unicorn turned slightly to keep an eye on her spells. And besides, gracefulness would come in time. All in all, she was confident that she had chosen well. Twilight would make a good Valkyrie.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'chapter_number': 3, 'parent_chapter_id': 323064, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'3\'></a><h3>Chapter 3</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Twilight watched in slight fascination as Luna went about the task of preparing a simple meal. At first, Twilight had wanted to question why on Equestria Princess Luna had a small kitchenette in her <i>study</i> of all places. Then Twilight reminded herself that Luna was a Princess, and therefore could have a kitchen anywhere she chose to. After that, Twilight became distracted just watching Luna. The Alicorn moved about the appliances with gentle grace, never once hurrying as she chopped some greens for a simple salad and sliced some fresh turkey meat for sandwiches. The latter was what Twilight was really looking forward to; Meat was quite rare in Equestria, as they could never grow it fast enough to feed an entire nation. Meat was usually reserved for special occasions like Hearth\xe2\x80\x99s Warming Eve, and the rest of the time the ponies of Equestria made due with enhanced fruits and vegetables.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It took Twilight a few moments to realize that she was no longer just watching the Princess work. Time and again Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were drawn to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly natural beauty. Princess Luna was only a stretch or two taller than Twilight, but the Princess still had legs that gave the impression of being miles long. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of <i>the</i> Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: <i>Military Equestria</i> and <i>Basic Guide to Magic</i>.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with <i>Military Equestria</i> and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.</p><p class="double"><center><u><b>Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.</b></u></center></p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> Equestrian Rangers</b> \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil.

In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.</i></p><p></center></p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.</p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> The Wonderbolts</b> \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave.

You are not in trouble. This is my way of gauging your magical aptitude. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything overly fancy to accomplish what I ask of you. All you should need to do is some levitation and a few other minor spells. I want to test your control and see how you go about completing everynight tasks. Firstly, I would like you to clean up after our lunch. After that, the fireplace needs cleaning out and the mantle dusted. The rugs need to be dirt free. Then you can start on my bookshelves. Dust them and clean them. Make sure my books are all categorized. Once you are finished, then I can get a better idea of where to start you in your training.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight perked up a bit. Housework was nothing new to her, despite being of noble birth; growing up in the palace instead of a foster home meant she had to clean her own room on numerous occasions. The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started. Horn shimmering with a low key magenta glow, she attacked the stuff left over from lunch. A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit. She then produced a small duster and proceeded to buff the mantle. By that time she had finished the lunch mess and moved onto the books and bookshelves.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna watched her student with interest. She was using and maintaining spells constantly, without conscious effort. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn didn\xe2\x80\x99t even shine any brighter than it had at first, signaling a record low power usage despite all the magic the unicorn was using. It was starting to look like taking Twilight as her personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 was a very good decision. As Luna watched her student, her eyes started to wander. Twilight was young, certainly, but no less an appealing mare. Her legs were sturdy and strong, a testimony to an active pony despite Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s love for books. The fact that Twilight was not some fat, lazy scholar was a very good thing, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s book. While Twilight was nowhere near as glossy and graceful as Luna, there was a certain symphony about her movements, as the unicorn turned slightly to keep an eye on her spells. And besides, gracefulness would come in time. All in all, she was confident that she had chosen well. Twilight would make a good Valkyrie.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 323064, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E29B50>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'3\'></a><h3>Chapter 3</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Twilight watched in slight fascination as Luna went about the task of preparing a simple meal. At first, Twilight had wanted to question why on Equestria Princess Luna had a small kitchenette in her <i>study</i> of all places. Then Twilight reminded herself that Luna was a Princess, and therefore could have a kitchen anywhere she chose to. After that, Twilight became distracted just watching Luna. The Alicorn moved about the appliances with gentle grace, never once hurrying as she chopped some greens for a simple salad and sliced some fresh turkey meat for sandwiches. The latter was what Twilight was really looking forward to; Meat was quite rare in Equestria, as they could never grow it fast enough to feed an entire nation. Meat was usually reserved for special occasions like Hearth\xe2\x80\x99s Warming Eve, and the rest of the time the ponies of Equestria made due with enhanced fruits and vegetables.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It took Twilight a few moments to realize that she was no longer just watching the Princess work. Time and again Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were drawn to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly natural beauty. Princess Luna was only a stretch or two taller than Twilight, but the Princess still had legs that gave the impression of being miles long. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of <i>the</i> Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: <i>Military Equestria</i> and <i>Basic Guide to Magic</i>.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with <i>Military Equestria</i> and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.</p><p class="double"><center><u><b>Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.</b></u></center></p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> Equestrian Rangers</b> \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil.

In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.</i></p><p></center></p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.</p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> The Wonderbolts</b> \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave. Ancient pegasi magic combined with aerial moves introduced by the iconic Commander Hurricane has given the Bolts a reputation well deserved. Undying loyalty to the Crown they serve and to each other leaves the Wonderbolts as Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s oldest military force.</i></center></p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So <i>that</i> was what Rainbow Dash was getting herself into.

All you should need to do is some levitation and a few other minor spells. I want to test your control and see how you go about completing everynight tasks. Firstly, I would like you to clean up after our lunch. After that, the fireplace needs cleaning out and the mantle dusted. The rugs need to be dirt free. Then you can start on my bookshelves. Dust them and clean them. Make sure my books are all categorized. Once you are finished, then I can get a better idea of where to start you in your training.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight perked up a bit. Housework was nothing new to her, despite being of noble birth; growing up in the palace instead of a foster home meant she had to clean her own room on numerous occasions. The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started. Horn shimmering with a low key magenta glow, she attacked the stuff left over from lunch. A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit. She then produced a small duster and proceeded to buff the mantle. By that time she had finished the lunch mess and moved onto the books and bookshelves.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna watched her student with interest. She was using and maintaining spells constantly, without conscious effort. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn didn\xe2\x80\x99t even shine any brighter than it had at first, signaling a record low power usage despite all the magic the unicorn was using. It was starting to look like taking Twilight as her personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 was a very good decision. As Luna watched her student, her eyes started to wander. Twilight was young, certainly, but no less an appealing mare. Her legs were sturdy and strong, a testimony to an active pony despite Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s love for books. The fact that Twilight was not some fat, lazy scholar was a very good thing, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s book. While Twilight was nowhere near as glossy and graceful as Luna, there was a certain symphony about her movements, as the unicorn turned slightly to keep an eye on her spells. And besides, gracefulness would come in time. All in all, she was confident that she had chosen well. Twilight would make a good Valkyrie.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 3// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tTwilight watched in slight fascination as Luna went about the task of preparing a simple meal. At first, Twilight had wanted to question why on Equestria Princess Luna had a small kitchenette in her study of all places. Then Twilight reminded herself that Luna was a Princess, and therefore could have a kitchen anywhere she chose to. After that, Twilight became distracted just watching Luna. The Alicorn moved about the appliances with gentle grace, never once hurrying as she chopped some greens for a simple salad and sliced some fresh turkey meat for sandwiches. The latter was what Twilight was really looking forward to; Meat was quite rare in Equestria, as they could never grow it fast enough to feed an entire nation. Meat was usually reserved for special occasions like Hearth\xe2\x80\x99s Warming Eve, and the rest of the time the ponies of Equestria made due with enhanced fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It took Twilight a few moments to realize that she was no longer just watching the Princess work. Time and again Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were drawn to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly natural beauty. Princess Luna was only a stretch or two taller than Twilight, but the Princess still had legs that gave the impression of being miles long. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of the Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: Military Equestria and Basic Guide to Magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with Military Equestria and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.\r\n\r\nEquestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Rangers \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil. This branch of the military acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cnational guard\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts, mobilizing in the event Equestria becomes invaded. In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wonderbolts \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave. Ancient pegasi magic combined with aerial moves introduced by the iconic Commander Hurricane has given the Bolts a reputation well deserved. Undying loyalty to the Crown they serve and to each other leaves the Wonderbolts as Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s oldest military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that was what Rainbow Dash was getting herself into. It sounded like the Wonderbolts strived to be the very best, all the time. It seemed rather unrealistic to Twilight, and the studious mare wondered if Dash would be up to the challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medic Corps \xe2\x80\x93The Medic Corps have been around as long as the Wonderbolts. Comprised of animal Whisperers and the best doctors Equestria can provide, the Corps is the singular force that keeps Equestria breathing. From combating sickness in Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s many cities and towns, to practicing their art upon the field of battle, the Corps provide the muscle behind recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, that certainly sounded right up Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s alley, if she could get over her intense shyness. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any other pony that would care so much for a complete stranger.\r\n\r\n\t Canterlot Guard --The Canterlot Guard is one of the last lines of defense for the Equestrian Crown. They mainly police the palace and the grounds itself, although it has been known for Canterlot Guards to sign contracts with other nobility.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was what Shining Armor was, a Canterlot Guard. Nothing made her brother happier than to be defending the Princess.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Intelligence  \xe2\x80\x93EI knows everything. A vast spy network comprised of undercover agents everywhere, Equestrian Intelligence ensures the nation they serve is prepared for anything. Every major plan, every notable event usually revolves around an EI combat agent. They operate from the shadows, usually shaping Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s future more than any other military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equestrian Intelligence had Pinkie Pie written all over it. That pony knew things about other ponies she had no business knowing about. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was a thought never spoken aloud. Pinkie Pie would still know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arcane Brigade \xe2\x80\x93If there is one thing the enemies of Equestria fear, it is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Arcane Brigade. Comprised of the most deadly spell casters ever born, the Brigade only enters a conflict when the need is dire. The Brigade guards their magical secrets jealously, ensuring that enemies know next to nothing about them. The Brigade is also responsible for Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s advancements with magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arcane Brigade. The name sent pleasing shivers down Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s spine. She had always dreamed that she would have a chance to join the Brigade, after learning all she could from a Master Mage. The Brigade solved everything, and Twilight would love nothing more than to be that part of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s forces. Perhaps Luna would allow her to join the Brigade after Twilight completed her training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Valkyrie \xe2\x80\x93If the Arcane Brigade brings fear to Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, then Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Valkyrie brings unbridled terror. Throughout Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s history, the Valkyrie has been a mare every bit as powerful as Princess Luna herself. Records show that victory is guaranteed when the Valkyrie takes to the battlefield. Mastering every branch of magic known to Sol, the Valkyrie is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s right hoof, meting out justice where she sees fit. The other branches of military also directly answer to the Valkyrie, rather than Princess Luna. \r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This  was a name that brought back foalhood memories. Everypony knew who the Valkyrie had been. Respected, feared, and loved as much as the Princess herself, the last Valkyrie vanished sometime during the giant War almost a thousand years ago. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, there has not been one since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Princess Luna  \xe2\x80\x93There has only been one instance where the Princess of Equestria has entered combat personally. This was back during the War of the Sun and Moon decades ago, when the usurper Corona Flare attempted to claim the throne of Equestria. The details of this war are vague at best, but it is a testament of Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s prowess that Corona Flare is no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight remembered reading vague details about this war. All anypony remembered was that Corona Flare attempted to usurp Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s position, to bring about never-ending day. After a vicious war, Princess Luna emerged victorious, and supposedly banished Flare into the Sun. At the time, Twilight had thought the tale was simply something to entertain young foals. After seeing Princess Luna up close, and feeling  her majestic power, Twilight was starting to think that perhaps there was a grain of truth to this story. With a thoughtful expression, Twilight opened the second text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magical Basics\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magic is a part of everything. From the visible and flashy magic of unicorns and other casters, to the more subtle passive magic of ground and fliers, magic is everywhere. Over the years, magic has branched out into ten different categories, each with their own counterpart. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There have been numerous disputes when categorizing magic as we know it. For example, a good many scholars and mages feel that Light and Night should be their own counterparts and that a new Accord Magic should be created for Destruction. However, this idea is not entirely sound and has been thus far ignored; Light magic focuses on strength, courage, and  creating new things, while Destruction does the exact opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight knew all of this already. But Princess Luna undoubtedly had some reason to bring this to the forefront of the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Twilight was interrupted from her thoughts by the reappearance of Luna, who had a strange gleam in her eye.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGood, you are finished reading! Now, let us set you up with some chores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cChores?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight echoed, confused. This was not what she had expected when Luna had said there she was going to teach Twilight magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYes, chores. Take a look around, Twilight. Are there any servants here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was confusion layered her voice, but she did have a small inkling of where this was going.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is not! Servants rarely ever approach my study and its hallway; it is the one place they are forbidden from!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This made sense. Twilight had noticed a distinct lack of servants on her walk here, despite the haze over her mind at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cSo then I am going to perform the cleaning they are unable to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Try as she might, Twilight could not hide the disappointment coloring her words.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna finally had mercy on her student. \xe2\x80\x9cRelax, Twilight. You are not in trouble. This is my way of gauging your magical aptitude. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything overly fancy to accomplish what I ask of you. All you should need to do is some levitation and a few other minor spells. I want to test your control and see how you go about completing everynight tasks. Firstly, I would like you to clean up after our lunch. After that, the fireplace needs cleaning out and the mantle dusted. The rugs need to be dirt free. Then you can start on my bookshelves. Dust them and clean them. Make sure my books are all categorized. Once you are finished, then I can get a better idea of where to start you in your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight perked up a bit. Housework was nothing new to her, despite being of noble birth; growing up in the palace instead of a foster home meant she had to clean her own room on numerous occasions. The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started. Horn shimmering with a low key magenta glow, she attacked the stuff left over from lunch. A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit. She then produced a small duster and proceeded to buff the mantle. By that time she had finished the lunch mess and moved onto the books and bookshelves.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna watched her student with interest. She was using and maintaining spells constantly, without conscious effort. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn didn\xe2\x80\x99t even shine any brighter than it had at first, signaling a record low power usage despite all the magic the unicorn was using. It was starting to look like taking Twilight as her personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 was a very good decision. As Luna watched her student, her eyes started to wander. Twilight was young, certainly, but no less an appealing mare. Her legs were sturdy and strong, a testimony to an active pony despite Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s love for books. The fact that Twilight was not some fat, lazy scholar was a very good thing, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s book. While Twilight was nowhere near as glossy and graceful as Luna, there was a certain symphony about her movements, as the unicorn turned slightly to keep an eye on her spells. And besides, gracefulness would come in time. All in all, she was confident that she had chosen well.

At first, Twilight had wanted to question why on Equestria Princess Luna had a small kitchenette in her <i>study</i> of all places. Then Twilight reminded herself that Luna was a Princess, and therefore could have a kitchen anywhere she chose to. After that, Twilight became distracted just watching Luna. The Alicorn moved about the appliances with gentle grace, never once hurrying as she chopped some greens for a simple salad and sliced some fresh turkey meat for sandwiches. The latter was what Twilight was really looking forward to; Meat was quite rare in Equestria, as they could never grow it fast enough to feed an entire nation. Meat was usually reserved for special occasions like Hearth\xe2\x80\x99s Warming Eve, and the rest of the time the ponies of Equestria made due with enhanced fruits and vegetables.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It took Twilight a few moments to realize that she was no longer just watching the Princess work. Time and again Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were drawn to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly natural beauty. Princess Luna was only a stretch or two taller than Twilight, but the Princess still had legs that gave the impression of being miles long. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of <i>the</i> Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: <i>Military Equestria</i> and <i>Basic Guide to Magic</i>.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with <i>Military Equestria</i> and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.</p><p class="double"><center><u><b>Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.</b></u></center></p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> Equestrian Rangers</b> \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil.

In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.</i></p><p></center></p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.</p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<center><i><b> The Wonderbolts</b> \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave. Ancient pegasi magic combined with aerial moves introduced by the iconic Commander Hurricane has given the Bolts a reputation well deserved. Undying loyalty to the Crown they serve and to each other leaves the Wonderbolts as Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s oldest military force.</i></center></p><p class="double"></p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So <i>that</i> was what Rainbow Dash was getting herself into.

The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started.

A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit.

Luna\xe2\x80\x99s backside was so smooth, rippling and coiling as the ruler of Equestria moved about. And her wings! They fanned the air gently every now and then as Luna stirred and mixed, full of downy tenderness and strong energy. \xc2\xa0Twilight felt her cheeks heat furiously and quickly averted her eyes, scolding herself for ogling the Princess so! Thankfully, by the time Princess Luna turned bearing a tray of food in her obsidian magic, Twilight had managed to wrest her blush under control. And her wandering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna plunked down a turkey and sunflower sandwich in front of her new student and set the salad aside for the moment. She gestured to the food. \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Twilight. I find it easier to learn new things on a full stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hesitating slightly (she was still in the presence of the Princess!) Twilight took a nibble from her sandwich. She immediately began eating with gusto, moaning slightly. It had been far too long since she had been able to have any meat at all. Princess Luna grinned, clearly pleased.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Princess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d came the swift correction, and Twilight smiled slightly.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly are you going to teach me about all ten branches of magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna actually arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not wish to learn more about magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was quick to assure her mentor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, Princess. But no other mage would accept an apprentice who wanted to study a branch of magic outside what they taught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna frowned briefly at the renewed use of her title before she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also no mere mage, Twilight Sparkle. You have not escaped my notice, living in the palace. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you diving into your studies, determined to learn everything you could about magic in general. Most other students are simply content to follow one path. Even from an early age, however, you were seeking knowledge on as many branches of magic as you could. Some magic, you discovered, are not exactly talked about in any depth in any of the books you\xe2\x80\x99ve studied. Friendship and Animosity are examples of this, as those two do not always manifest in the clearest ways possible. Others, like Necromancy, are not talked about at all, merely glossed over with a hurried explanation. Yet no matter what you managed to read, no book at the Canterlot Archives actually taught you the proper techniques for magic, did they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight took another bite of her sandwich before answering. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. What little I do know about magic I taught myself. It was enough that I could impress any Master I wanted. But that plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a single mage at the time of my Choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I warned them to stay away, Twilight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna spoke gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them, under no circumstances, were any Mage to appear at your Choosing. I had chosen you to be my next prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e long before any of those fools had their eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight looked up at this revelation, eyes wide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Princess? I am naught but a curious unicorn filly who loves to read. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to your expectations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna chuckled a tiny bit, finally understanding what was eating away at her new student. \xe2\x80\x9cI chose you because I can see your potential, Twilight Sparkle. And I shall leave it at that. But know this: If you do not live up to my expectations, then I will keep trying until you get it right. I know you will always put forth your best effort, but not every pony can just automatically be good at everything. I want to help guide you upon your journey, and I cannot do that if I abandon you over a small mistake. Now, come. I see that you have finished your lunch, as have I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some books I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to read a few passages from. After that, I believe I can find some other stuff for you to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna stood up, clearing the small table with a pulse from her horn. In the same pulse, she levitated two thick tomes over to Twilight. Tilting her head sideways, Twilight read the titles: Military Equestria and Basic Guide to Magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese two books will become your primary sources of information for the time being. A good deal of your initial studies will revolve around these two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already marked the pages I would like you to read from. Start with Military Equestria and go from there. I must take care of a small bit of business, and then I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, Princess Luna was gone. Frowning a bit at her teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sudden disappearance, Twilight cracked open the first book she had been told to read. The unicorn rifled through the pages until she found the pages marked by a magical bookmark and began to read.\r\n\r\nEquestria\xe2\x80\x99s Military Forces.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Rangers \xe2\x80\x93The Rangers very rarely fight off of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s soil. This branch of the military acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cnational guard\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts, mobilizing in the event Equestria becomes invaded. In times of relative peace, the Rangers comprise about sixty percent of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s food sources, farming land in addition to performing regular military exercises. If Equestria is ever besieged, only forty percent of the Ranger\xe2\x80\x99s full might are ever engaged at one time, allowing the nation to continue to produce enough food to withstand an invasion that may last years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was certainly interesting. Twilight had known that Equestrian Rangers were designed to protect the Crown, but she had no idea that their deployment was so intricate. With a good portion of the Rangers still helping produce food, Equestria would prove to be a difficult nation to take by direct force. Twilight read on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Wonderbolts \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cFaster, Swifter, Stronger\xe2\x80\x9d is the motto of the Wonderbolts, and it is a motto they strive to uphold each and every night. The Bolts are hands down the best aerial force Sol has ever seen, the first deployed to an engagement and the last to leave. Ancient pegasi magic combined with aerial moves introduced by the iconic Commander Hurricane has given the Bolts a reputation well deserved. Undying loyalty to the Crown they serve and to each other leaves the Wonderbolts as Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s oldest military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that was what Rainbow Dash was getting herself into. It sounded like the Wonderbolts strived to be the very best, all the time. It seemed rather unrealistic to Twilight, and the studious mare wondered if Dash would be up to the challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medic Corps \xe2\x80\x93The Medic Corps have been around as long as the Wonderbolts. Comprised of animal Whisperers and the best doctors Equestria can provide, the Corps is the singular force that keeps Equestria breathing. From combating sickness in Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s many cities and towns, to practicing their art upon the field of battle, the Corps provide the muscle behind recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, that certainly sounded right up Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s alley, if she could get over her intense shyness. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any other pony that would care so much for a complete stranger.\r\n\r\n\t Canterlot Guard --The Canterlot Guard is one of the last lines of defense for the Equestrian Crown. They mainly police the palace and the grounds itself, although it has been known for Canterlot Guards to sign contracts with other nobility.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was what Shining Armor was, a Canterlot Guard. Nothing made her brother happier than to be defending the Princess.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Equestrian Intelligence  \xe2\x80\x93EI knows everything. A vast spy network comprised of undercover agents everywhere, Equestrian Intelligence ensures the nation they serve is prepared for anything. Every major plan, every notable event usually revolves around an EI combat agent. They operate from the shadows, usually shaping Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s future more than any other military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equestrian Intelligence had Pinkie Pie written all over it. That pony knew things about other ponies she had no business knowing about. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was a thought never spoken aloud. Pinkie Pie would still know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arcane Brigade \xe2\x80\x93If there is one thing the enemies of Equestria fear, it is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Arcane Brigade. Comprised of the most deadly spell casters ever born, the Brigade only enters a conflict when the need is dire. The Brigade guards their magical secrets jealously, ensuring that enemies know next to nothing about them. The Brigade is also responsible for Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s advancements with magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arcane Brigade. The name sent pleasing shivers down Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s spine. She had always dreamed that she would have a chance to join the Brigade, after learning all she could from a Master Mage. The Brigade solved everything, and Twilight would love nothing more than to be that part of Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s forces. Perhaps Luna would allow her to join the Brigade after Twilight completed her training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Valkyrie \xe2\x80\x93If the Arcane Brigade brings fear to Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, then Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Valkyrie brings unbridled terror. Throughout Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s history, the Valkyrie has been a mare every bit as powerful as Princess Luna herself. Records show that victory is guaranteed when the Valkyrie takes to the battlefield. Mastering every branch of magic known to Sol, the Valkyrie is Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s right hoof, meting out justice where she sees fit. The other branches of military also directly answer to the Valkyrie, rather than Princess Luna. \r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This  was a name that brought back foalhood memories. Everypony knew who the Valkyrie had been. Respected, feared, and loved as much as the Princess herself, the last Valkyrie vanished sometime during the giant War almost a thousand years ago. To the best of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, there has not been one since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Princess Luna  \xe2\x80\x93There has only been one instance where the Princess of Equestria has entered combat personally. This was back during the War of the Sun and Moon decades ago, when the usurper Corona Flare attempted to claim the throne of Equestria. The details of this war are vague at best, but it is a testament of Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s prowess that Corona Flare is no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight remembered reading vague details about this war. All anypony remembered was that Corona Flare attempted to usurp Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s position, to bring about never-ending day. After a vicious war, Princess Luna emerged victorious, and supposedly banished Flare into the Sun. At the time, Twilight had thought the tale was simply something to entertain young foals. After seeing Princess Luna up close, and feeling  her majestic power, Twilight was starting to think that perhaps there was a grain of truth to this story. With a thoughtful expression, Twilight opened the second text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magical Basics\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magic is a part of everything. From the visible and flashy magic of unicorns and other casters, to the more subtle passive magic of ground and fliers, magic is everywhere. Over the years, magic has branched out into ten different categories, each with their own counterpart. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There have been numerous disputes when categorizing magic as we know it. For example, a good many scholars and mages feel that Light and Night should be their own counterparts and that a new Accord Magic should be created for Destruction. However, this idea is not entirely sound and has been thus far ignored; Light magic focuses on strength, courage, and  creating new things, while Destruction does the exact opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight knew all of this already. But Princess Luna undoubtedly had some reason to bring this to the forefront of the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Twilight was interrupted from her thoughts by the reappearance of Luna, who had a strange gleam in her eye.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGood, you are finished reading! Now, let us set you up with some chores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cChores?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight echoed, confused. This was not what she had expected when Luna had said there she was going to teach Twilight magic.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYes, chores. Take a look around, Twilight. Are there any servants here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was confusion layered her voice, but she did have a small inkling of where this was going.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is not! Servants rarely ever approach my study and its hallway; it is the one place they are forbidden from!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This made sense. Twilight had noticed a distinct lack of servants on her walk here, despite the haze over her mind at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cSo then I am going to perform the cleaning they are unable to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Try as she might, Twilight could not hide the disappointment coloring her words.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna finally had mercy on her student. \xe2\x80\x9cRelax, Twilight. You are not in trouble. This is my way of gauging your magical aptitude. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything overly fancy to accomplish what I ask of you. All you should need to do is some levitation and a few other minor spells. I want to test your control and see how you go about completing everynight tasks. Firstly, I would like you to clean up after our lunch. After that, the fireplace needs cleaning out and the mantle dusted. The rugs need to be dirt free. Then you can start on my bookshelves. Dust them and clean them. Make sure my books are all categorized. Once you are finished, then I can get a better idea of where to start you in your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight perked up a bit. Housework was nothing new to her, despite being of noble birth; growing up in the palace instead of a foster home meant she had to clean her own room on numerous occasions. The fact that the Princess wanted Twilight use magic made the work more bearable. Humming a faint tune, Twilight got started. Horn shimmering with a low key magenta glow, she attacked the stuff left over from lunch. A single horn wave removed leftover foodstuffs from utensils and surfaces, and then a further wave sent the implements sailing back to their proper place in the kitchenette. At the same time the purple unicorn attacked the fireplace, Vanishing the ash left over from its last use and whitening the bricks a bit. She then produced a small duster and proceeded to buff the mantle. By that time she had finished the lunch mess and moved onto the books and bookshelves.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Princess Luna watched her student with interest. She was using and maintaining spells constantly, without conscious effort. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn didn\xe2\x80\x99t even shine any brighter than it had at first, signaling a record low power usage despite all the magic the unicorn was using. It was starting to look like taking Twilight as her personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 was a very good decision. As Luna watched her student, her eyes started to wander. Twilight was young, certainly, but no less an appealing mare. Her legs were sturdy and strong, a testimony to an active pony despite Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s love for books. The fact that Twilight was not some fat, lazy scholar was a very good thing, in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s book. While Twilight was nowhere near as glossy and graceful as Luna, there was a certain symphony about her movements, as the unicorn turned slightly to keep an eye on her spells. And besides, gracefulness would come in time. All in all, she was confident that she had chosen well. Twilight would make a good Valkyrie.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'epub': None}

The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.\r\n\r\n\tIt was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.\r\n\r\n\tA clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered. Every year, the day after her birthday, Twilight and Shining Armor would meet in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s favorite garden, and then proceed to the site of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Twilight knew that the graves were empty; the bodies of her mother and father had never been recovered from their last Equestrian Intelligence field mission. But this fact never deterred the Sparkle siblings. The memory and spirit of their parents were enough. Truth be told, it was all they had, aside from each other. This ritual was what helped both of the young ponies cope with the fact that their parents were long since gone. Unlike Shining Armor, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of both Twilight Velvet and Night Light were vague at best. She had been barely more than four years old at their passing, and the most she could recall were their voices. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why, but she knew their voices as well as she knew her own.\r\n\r\n\tShining had it a bit more roughly than his baby sister. He had been six when the unexpected news was brought to them. Undoubtedly he could remember every detail of that fateful day, although he never talked about it. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure he could talk about it. He never once recounted that day to his sister, as if he wanted to spare her those terrifying memories. Twilight really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault his logic, either: he was doing his best to protect his little Twilight. And that was extended to ensuring a particular memory was left unspoken of. Twilight sighed to herself softly before gently easing out of her quarters, gently treading past Rarity\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\tLike usual, she found Shining Armor already waiting for her at the entrance to the gardens. Also like usual, he was in full guard uniform.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwiley!\xe2\x80\x9d Shining Armor exclaimed upon sighting the young unicorn. He pulled her into a firm hug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again, little sis. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either. He brother knew her, the real her, the unicorn who preferred books over real friends (the other Orphans didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count). She could even feel the extra spring in her step, one that Shining noticed and chuckled over. Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.\r\n\r\n\tAs always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:\r\n\r\n Night Light Sparkle\r\nHusband and father, may he never be forgotten\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:\r\n\r\n Twilight Velvet\r\nWife and mother, may she never be forgotten.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but all magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was still beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who told you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you please stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!"\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year. When Rainbow had applied for the Wonderbolts, Rainbow had an interesting notion of sleek pegasi screaming through the sky, while lesser ponies stared on with awed admiration. To her, the Wonderbolts had been the epitome of adventure and carefree flying, and Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi to be envied.\r\n\r\n\tIt seemed that reality had a harsh wake up call. So far, Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi who rose before the light of dawn and spent the hour before breakfast partaking in a rigorous course of physical training: galloping, using their wings to lift weights, and balancing upon their hind hooves and walking that way. Already tired from all of this, they had a chance to take a minute, then return to their dormitories, shower with cold water, and then make sure their dormitories were completely spotless. If there was so much as a misplaced speck of dust upon the floor, Soarin\xe2\x80\x99, Wonderbolt second-in-command, would dump the contents of their kits onto the floor, upend their beds, and force them to do it all over again\xe2\x80\x94during the time they should be having breakfast.\r\n\r\n\tBreakfast, naturally, was nothing special\xe2\x80\x94completely basic and barely filling. But Rainbow Dash was used to little breakfast during her personal training days, and so never complained even if she missed breakfast. The other new cadets weren\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and if they missed breakfast, it as a long hard morning until lunch at mid afternoon. And even lunch was only about half an hour long. After breakfast there came three hours of classes for military history, tactical advantages, and so on; these classes were certainly not Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit. She hated anything to do with sitting still for an extended period of time or reading. But she soldiered through them, knowing that she would never become a Wonderbolt if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn all of this important stuff.\r\n\r\n\tThen after these classes, the cadets were required to run an obstacle course before they were allowed to head to lunch. The course was littered with rogue thunderclouds, shifting winds, and freezing patches of water. It also had to be completed in three minutes, and if somepony failed to complete it within that time, they were sent back to the start to try again\xe2\x80\x94often resulting in lost time for lunch. While Rainbow as familiar with sometimes skipping breakfast, or having a sparse one, going without lunch was torture for the mare; as a result, she quickly learned to not make mistakes during the obstacle course.\r\n\r\n\tThen after lunch came even more classes that bored the chromatic pegasus to tears, then a series of aerial challenges designed to put your wings to the test\xe2\x80\x94and even though Rainbow knew she exceeded well here, the challenges were still grueling and always varying. After those exercises, the cadets would form ranks and perform combat drills until the end of the school day, where they had two hours to themselves to unwind a tiny bit, repair gear and prepare for classes the next day\xe2\x80\x94unless somepony earned a demerit during the day. If somepony earned a demerit, all of the cadets were punished. They were ordered to load their saddlebags full of rocks, and then had to complete the obstacle course five times in a row without stopping.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow had just finished one such run. Earlier in the day, one of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s classmates was caught passing a note in Aerodynamics 1, and the instructor, Fleetfoot, confiscated it and read it out to the class: Apparently the pegasus stallion in question was attempting to set up a place for a little\xe2\x80\xa6 tryst\xe2\x80\xa6 with his marefriend after lights out and everypony else was supposed to be asleep. After assuring that there will never be any such activates allowed at the Academy, Fleetfoot had shredded the note and invited the entire class to fill their saddlebags and get to flying. After several snubs directed at the pegasus, the class did as they had been bid.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash had eventually felt herself pulling away from the rest of them as she rounded the first bend of the course. Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.\r\n\r\n\tNo sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow Crash? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'chapter_number': 4, 'parent_chapter_id': 337428, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'4\'></a><h3>Chapter 4</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Twilight Sparkle lay there, staring up at the ceiling above her. The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.</p><p class="indented double">It was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.</p><p class="indented double">A clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered.

I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either.

Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.</p><p class="indented double">As always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Night Light Sparkle</p><p>Husband and father, may he never be forgotten</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Twilight Velvet</p><p>Wife and mother, may she never be forgotten.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but <i>all</i> magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was <i>still</i> beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who <i>told</i> you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you <i>please</i> stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!&nbsp;&nbsp;We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!&quot;</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year. When Rainbow had applied for the Wonderbolts, Rainbow had an interesting notion of sleek pegasi screaming through the sky, while lesser ponies stared on with awed admiration. To her, the Wonderbolts had been the epitome of adventure and carefree flying, and Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi to be envied.</p><p class="indented double">It seemed that reality had a harsh wake up call. So far, Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi who rose before the light of dawn and spent the hour before breakfast partaking in a rigorous course of physical training: galloping, using their wings to lift weights, and balancing upon their hind hooves and walking that way. Already tired from all of this, they had a chance to take a minute, then return to their dormitories, shower with cold water, and then make sure their dormitories were completely spotless. If there was so much as a misplaced speck of dust upon the floor, Soarin\xe2\x80\x99, Wonderbolt second-in-command, would dump the contents of their kits onto the floor, upend their beds, and force them to do it all over again\xe2\x80\x94during the time they should be having breakfast.</p><p class="indented double">Breakfast, naturally, was nothing special\xe2\x80\x94completely basic and barely filling. But Rainbow Dash was used to little breakfast during her personal training days, and so never complained even if she missed breakfast. The other new cadets weren\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and if they missed breakfast, it as a long hard morning until lunch at mid afternoon. And even lunch was only about half an hour long. After breakfast there came three hours of classes for military history, tactical advantages, and so on; these classes were certainly not Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit. She hated anything to do with sitting still for an extended period of time or reading. But she soldiered through them, knowing that she would never become a Wonderbolt if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn all of this important stuff.</p><p class="indented double">Then after these classes, the cadets were required to run an obstacle course before they were allowed to head to lunch. The course was littered with rogue thunderclouds, shifting winds, and freezing patches of water. It also had to be completed in three minutes, and if somepony failed to complete it within that time, they were sent back to the start to try again\xe2\x80\x94often resulting in lost time for lunch. While Rainbow as familiar with sometimes skipping breakfast, or having a sparse one, going without lunch was torture for the mare; as a result, she quickly learned to not make mistakes during the obstacle course.</p><p class="indented double">Then after lunch came even more classes that bored the chromatic pegasus to tears, then a series of aerial challenges designed to put your wings to the test\xe2\x80\x94and even though Rainbow <i>knew</i> she exceeded well here, the challenges were still grueling and always varying. After those exercises, the cadets would form ranks and perform combat drills until the end of the school day, where they had two hours to themselves to unwind a tiny bit, repair gear and prepare for classes the next day\xe2\x80\x94unless somepony earned a demerit during the day. If somepony earned a demerit, <i>all</i> of the cadets were punished. They were ordered to load their saddlebags full of rocks, and then had to complete the obstacle course five times in a row without stopping.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow had just finished one such run. Earlier in the day, one of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s classmates was caught passing a note in Aerodynamics 1, and the instructor, Fleetfoot, confiscated it and read it out to the class: Apparently the pegasus stallion in question was attempting to set up a place for a little\xe2\x80\xa6 tryst\xe2\x80\xa6 with his marefriend after lights out and everypony else was supposed to be asleep. After assuring that there will never be any such activates allowed at the Academy, Fleetfoot had shredded the note and invited the entire class to fill their saddlebags and get to flying. After several snubs directed at the pegasus, the class did as they had been bid.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash had eventually felt herself pulling away from the rest of them as she rounded the first bend of the course. Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.</p><p class="indented double">No sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow <i>Crash</i>? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 337428, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E29F30>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'4\'></a><h3>Chapter 4</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Twilight Sparkle lay there, staring up at the ceiling above her. The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.</p><p class="indented double">It was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.</p><p class="indented double">A clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered. Every year, the day after her birthday, Twilight and Shining Armor would meet in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s favorite garden, and then proceed to the site of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Twilight knew that the graves were empty; the bodies of her mother and father had never been recovered from their last Equestrian Intelligence field mission. But this fact never deterred the Sparkle siblings. The memory and spirit of their parents were enough. Truth be told, it was all they had, aside from each other. This ritual was what helped both of the young ponies cope with the fact that their parents were long since gone. Unlike Shining Armor, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of both Twilight Velvet and Night Light were vague at best. She had been barely more than four years old at their passing, and the most she could recall were their voices. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why, but she knew their voices as well as she knew her own.</p><p class="indented double">Shining had it a bit more roughly than his baby sister. He had been six when the unexpected news was brought to them. Undoubtedly he could remember every detail of that fateful day, although he never talked about it. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure he <i>could</i> talk about it. He never once recounted that day to his sister, as if he wanted to spare her those terrifying memories. Twilight really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault his logic, either: he was doing his best to protect his little Twilight. And that was extended to ensuring a particular memory was left unspoken of. Twilight sighed to herself softly before gently easing out of her quarters, gently treading past Rarity\xe2\x80\x99s door.</p><p class="indented double">Like usual, she found Shining Armor already waiting for her at the entrance to the gardens. Also like usual, he was in full guard uniform.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwiley!\xe2\x80\x9d Shining Armor exclaimed upon sighting the young unicorn. He pulled her into a firm hug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again, little sis. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either. He brother knew her, the real her, the unicorn who preferred books over real friends (the other Orphans didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count). She could even feel the extra spring in her step, one that Shining noticed and chuckled over. Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.</p><p class="indented double">As always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Night Light Sparkle</p><p>Husband and father, may he never be forgotten</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Twilight Velvet</p><p>Wife and mother, may she never be forgotten.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but <i>all</i> magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was <i>still</i> beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who <i>told</i> you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you <i>please</i> stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!&nbsp;&nbsp;We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!&quot;</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year. When Rainbow had applied for the Wonderbolts, Rainbow had an interesting notion of sleek pegasi screaming through the sky, while lesser ponies stared on with awed admiration. To her, the Wonderbolts had been the epitome of adventure and carefree flying, and Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi to be envied.</p><p class="indented double">It seemed that reality had a harsh wake up call. So far, Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi who rose before the light of dawn and spent the hour before breakfast partaking in a rigorous course of physical training: galloping, using their wings to lift weights, and balancing upon their hind hooves and walking that way. Already tired from all of this, they had a chance to take a minute, then return to their dormitories, shower with cold water, and then make sure their dormitories were completely spotless. If there was so much as a misplaced speck of dust upon the floor, Soarin\xe2\x80\x99, Wonderbolt second-in-command, would dump the contents of their kits onto the floor, upend their beds, and force them to do it all over again\xe2\x80\x94during the time they should be having breakfast.</p><p class="indented double">Breakfast, naturally, was nothing special\xe2\x80\x94completely basic and barely filling. But Rainbow Dash was used to little breakfast during her personal training days, and so never complained even if she missed breakfast. The other new cadets weren\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and if they missed breakfast, it as a long hard morning until lunch at mid afternoon. And even lunch was only about half an hour long. After breakfast there came three hours of classes for military history, tactical advantages, and so on; these classes were certainly not Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit. She hated anything to do with sitting still for an extended period of time or reading. But she soldiered through them, knowing that she would never become a Wonderbolt if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn all of this important stuff.</p><p class="indented double">Then after these classes, the cadets were required to run an obstacle course before they were allowed to head to lunch. The course was littered with rogue thunderclouds, shifting winds, and freezing patches of water. It also had to be completed in three minutes, and if somepony failed to complete it within that time, they were sent back to the start to try again\xe2\x80\x94often resulting in lost time for lunch. While Rainbow as familiar with sometimes skipping breakfast, or having a sparse one, going without lunch was torture for the mare; as a result, she quickly learned to not make mistakes during the obstacle course.</p><p class="indented double">Then after lunch came even more classes that bored the chromatic pegasus to tears, then a series of aerial challenges designed to put your wings to the test\xe2\x80\x94and even though Rainbow <i>knew</i> she exceeded well here, the challenges were still grueling and always varying. After those exercises, the cadets would form ranks and perform combat drills until the end of the school day, where they had two hours to themselves to unwind a tiny bit, repair gear and prepare for classes the next day\xe2\x80\x94unless somepony earned a demerit during the day. If somepony earned a demerit, <i>all</i> of the cadets were punished. They were ordered to load their saddlebags full of rocks, and then had to complete the obstacle course five times in a row without stopping.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow had just finished one such run. Earlier in the day, one of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s classmates was caught passing a note in Aerodynamics 1, and the instructor, Fleetfoot, confiscated it and read it out to the class: Apparently the pegasus stallion in question was attempting to set up a place for a little\xe2\x80\xa6 tryst\xe2\x80\xa6 with his marefriend after lights out and everypony else was supposed to be asleep. After assuring that there will never be any such activates allowed at the Academy, Fleetfoot had shredded the note and invited the entire class to fill their saddlebags and get to flying. After several snubs directed at the pegasus, the class did as they had been bid.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash had eventually felt herself pulling away from the rest of them as she rounded the first bend of the course. Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.</p><p class="indented double">No sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow <i>Crash</i>? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 4// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tTwilight Sparkle lay there, staring up at the ceiling above her. The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.\r\n\r\n\tIt was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.\r\n\r\n\tA clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered. Every year, the day after her birthday, Twilight and Shining Armor would meet in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s favorite garden, and then proceed to the site of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Twilight knew that the graves were empty; the bodies of her mother and father had never been recovered from their last Equestrian Intelligence field mission. But this fact never deterred the Sparkle siblings. The memory and spirit of their parents were enough. Truth be told, it was all they had, aside from each other. This ritual was what helped both of the young ponies cope with the fact that their parents were long since gone. Unlike Shining Armor, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of both Twilight Velvet and Night Light were vague at best. She had been barely more than four years old at their passing, and the most she could recall were their voices. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why, but she knew their voices as well as she knew her own.\r\n\r\n\tShining had it a bit more roughly than his baby sister. He had been six when the unexpected news was brought to them. Undoubtedly he could remember every detail of that fateful day, although he never talked about it. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure he could talk about it. He never once recounted that day to his sister, as if he wanted to spare her those terrifying memories. Twilight really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault his logic, either: he was doing his best to protect his little Twilight. And that was extended to ensuring a particular memory was left unspoken of. Twilight sighed to herself softly before gently easing out of her quarters, gently treading past Rarity\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\tLike usual, she found Shining Armor already waiting for her at the entrance to the gardens. Also like usual, he was in full guard uniform.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwiley!\xe2\x80\x9d Shining Armor exclaimed upon sighting the young unicorn. He pulled her into a firm hug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again, little sis. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either. He brother knew her, the real her, the unicorn who preferred books over real friends (the other Orphans didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count). She could even feel the extra spring in her step, one that Shining noticed and chuckled over. Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.\r\n\r\n\tAs always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:\r\n\r\n Night Light Sparkle\r\nHusband and father, may he never be forgotten\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:\r\n\r\n Twilight Velvet\r\nWife and mother, may she never be forgotten.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but all magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was still beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who told you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you please stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!"\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year. When Rainbow had applied for the Wonderbolts, Rainbow had an interesting notion of sleek pegasi screaming through the sky, while lesser ponies stared on with awed admiration. To her, the Wonderbolts had been the epitome of adventure and carefree flying, and Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi to be envied.\r\n\r\n\tIt seemed that reality had a harsh wake up call. So far, Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi who rose before the light of dawn and spent the hour before breakfast partaking in a rigorous course of physical training: galloping, using their wings to lift weights, and balancing upon their hind hooves and walking that way. Already tired from all of this, they had a chance to take a minute, then return to their dormitories, shower with cold water, and then make sure their dormitories were completely spotless. If there was so much as a misplaced speck of dust upon the floor, Soarin\xe2\x80\x99, Wonderbolt second-in-command, would dump the contents of their kits onto the floor, upend their beds, and force them to do it all over again\xe2\x80\x94during the time they should be having breakfast.\r\n\r\n\tBreakfast, naturally, was nothing special\xe2\x80\x94completely basic and barely filling. But Rainbow Dash was used to little breakfast during her personal training days, and so never complained even if she missed breakfast. The other new cadets weren\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and if they missed breakfast, it as a long hard morning until lunch at mid afternoon. And even lunch was only about half an hour long. After breakfast there came three hours of classes for military history, tactical advantages, and so on; these classes were certainly not Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit. She hated anything to do with sitting still for an extended period of time or reading. But she soldiered through them, knowing that she would never become a Wonderbolt if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn all of this important stuff.\r\n\r\n\tThen after these classes, the cadets were required to run an obstacle course before they were allowed to head to lunch. The course was littered with rogue thunderclouds, shifting winds, and freezing patches of water. It also had to be completed in three minutes, and if somepony failed to complete it within that time, they were sent back to the start to try again\xe2\x80\x94often resulting in lost time for lunch. While Rainbow as familiar with sometimes skipping breakfast, or having a sparse one, going without lunch was torture for the mare; as a result, she quickly learned to not make mistakes during the obstacle course.\r\n\r\n\tThen after lunch came even more classes that bored the chromatic pegasus to tears, then a series of aerial challenges designed to put your wings to the test\xe2\x80\x94and even though Rainbow knew she exceeded well here, the challenges were still grueling and always varying. After those exercises, the cadets would form ranks and perform combat drills until the end of the school day, where they had two hours to themselves to unwind a tiny bit, repair gear and prepare for classes the next day\xe2\x80\x94unless somepony earned a demerit during the day. If somepony earned a demerit, all of the cadets were punished. They were ordered to load their saddlebags full of rocks, and then had to complete the obstacle course five times in a row without stopping.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow had just finished one such run. Earlier in the day, one of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s classmates was caught passing a note in Aerodynamics 1, and the instructor, Fleetfoot, confiscated it and read it out to the class: Apparently the pegasus stallion in question was attempting to set up a place for a little\xe2\x80\xa6 tryst\xe2\x80\xa6 with his marefriend after lights out and everypony else was supposed to be asleep. After assuring that there will never be any such activates allowed at the Academy, Fleetfoot had shredded the note and invited the entire class to fill their saddlebags and get to flying. After several snubs directed at the pegasus, the class did as they had been bid.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash had eventually felt herself pulling away from the rest of them as she rounded the first bend of the course. Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.\r\n\r\n\tNo sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow Crash? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n', 4, 337428, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'4\'></a><h3>Chapter 4</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Twilight Sparkle lay there, staring up at the ceiling above her. The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.</p><p class="indented double">It was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.</p><p class="indented double">The thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.</p><p class="indented double">A clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered. Every year, the day after her birthday, Twilight and Shining Armor would meet in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s favorite garden, and then proceed to the site of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Twilight knew that the graves were empty; the bodies of her mother and father had never been recovered from their last Equestrian Intelligence field mission. But this fact never deterred the Sparkle siblings. The memory and spirit of their parents were enough. Truth be told, it was all they had, aside from each other. This ritual was what helped both of the young ponies cope with the fact that their parents were long since gone. Unlike Shining Armor, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of both Twilight Velvet and Night Light were vague at best. She had been barely more than four years old at their passing, and the most she could recall were their voices. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why, but she knew their voices as well as she knew her own.</p><p class="indented double">Shining had it a bit more roughly than his baby sister. He had been six when the unexpected news was brought to them. Undoubtedly he could remember every detail of that fateful day, although he never talked about it. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure he <i>could</i> talk about it. He never once recounted that day to his sister, as if he wanted to spare her those terrifying memories. Twilight really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault his logic, either: he was doing his best to protect his little Twilight. And that was extended to ensuring a particular memory was left unspoken of. Twilight sighed to herself softly before gently easing out of her quarters, gently treading past Rarity\xe2\x80\x99s door.</p><p class="indented double">Like usual, she found Shining Armor already waiting for her at the entrance to the gardens. Also like usual, he was in full guard uniform.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwiley!\xe2\x80\x9d Shining Armor exclaimed upon sighting the young unicorn. He pulled her into a firm hug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again, little sis. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either. He brother knew her, the real her, the unicorn who preferred books over real friends (the other Orphans didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count). She could even feel the extra spring in her step, one that Shining noticed and chuckled over. Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.</p><p class="indented double">As always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Night Light Sparkle</p><p>Husband and father, may he never be forgotten</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:</p><p class="double"><center><i> Twilight Velvet</p><p>Wife and mother, may she never be forgotten.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d</i></center></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but <i>all</i> magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Silence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was <i>still</i> beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who <i>told</i> you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you <i>please</i> stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!&nbsp;&nbsp;We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!&quot;</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year.

Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.</p><p class="indented double">No sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow <i>Crash</i>? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Dash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 4// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tTwilight Sparkle lay there, staring up at the ceiling above her. The bed was softer and more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on. Her personal quarters were far bigger than she was used to, and yet none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered were her slow breaths and her own thoughts. In just a few short hours, she will have been Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student for a full night. The full implications daunted her as much as they thrilled her. Nopony else in years has ever been in the position she found herself in. She had asked, curious as to why she was different from the other apprentices Luna had. Luna had told her, quite simply, that Twilight was in an entirely different league just because of her drive for knowledge and her own formidable power. Most apprentices, like Rarity, were content with choosing one branch of magic and studying every bit of magic that branch held. Twilight had become different just because she wanted to know more.\r\n\r\n\tIt was almost too much to take in. This time yesternight, she had been a young unicorn, an orphan, who had no idea exactly what was going to happen with her future. In hindsight, narrowing it down to finding a Master or a Mate was a bit foolish of her. Foolish or not, however, Twilight knew that if she had decided to do anything but become an apprentice, the Nobles of Canterlot would not have rested until they had added her to one of their own families. Twilight had spent enough time in Canterlot to know that was just how the nobles worked. They only looked out for themselves, first and foremost, and nothing else mattered. With the near decimation of the Twinkle House, there was now only one, maybe two Houses still completely dedicated solely to the Crown. The rest of them were utterly worthless for anything.\r\n\r\n\tThe thought of House Twinkle\xe2\x80\x99s plight brought a slight frown to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips as she thought. Now that she was out of the shadow of other greedy nobles, perhaps she could begin to rebuild House Twinkle? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to marry if she did not want to; it would be easy enough to find deserving ponies and turn them into lesser nobles. Twilight even doubted that Princess Luna would have a problem with this idea. Other nobles would be incensed; bringing in outside blood to dilute the pure blood of nobility was an unthinkable crime. But Twilight had never really cared for their self-imposed ideals. It was a pony\xe2\x80\x99s actions and contributions to society that made a pony worthy of being a noble, not the blood that ran through their veins. Or, maybe she could go one better: She could see what would be needed to turn House Twinkle into a clan.\r\n\r\n\tA clan was a massive group of several nobles united under a single banner, or even the same set of ideals. The last clan recorded in the Equestrian Annals was way back in ancient times, when Princess Platinum led the unicorn faction with an iron fist. The only problem was, the Twinkle House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way to offer other nobles as an incentive to form a clan. Twilight was not about to offer herself or her brother. Maybe she could ask Princess Luna for aid. She was sure her new mentor could come up with something; Twilight very much doubted Luna would want to lose the most loyal Equestrian House to the Crown. Resolving to broach the subject sometime later, Twilight Sparkle finally rolled out of her too soft bed and onto her hooves. Judging by the lightening of the sky outside her windows, she had perhaps an hour and a half before Princess Luna would brighten the moon, signalling a new night.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight then began a routine she has partaken in for as long as she remembered. Every year, the day after her birthday, Twilight and Shining Armor would meet in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s favorite garden, and then proceed to the site of their parent\xe2\x80\x99s grave. Twilight knew that the graves were empty; the bodies of her mother and father had never been recovered from their last Equestrian Intelligence field mission. But this fact never deterred the Sparkle siblings. The memory and spirit of their parents were enough. Truth be told, it was all they had, aside from each other. This ritual was what helped both of the young ponies cope with the fact that their parents were long since gone. Unlike Shining Armor, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of both Twilight Velvet and Night Light were vague at best. She had been barely more than four years old at their passing, and the most she could recall were their voices. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why, but she knew their voices as well as she knew her own.\r\n\r\n\tShining had it a bit more roughly than his baby sister. He had been six when the unexpected news was brought to them. Undoubtedly he could remember every detail of that fateful day, although he never talked about it. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure he could talk about it. He never once recounted that day to his sister, as if he wanted to spare her those terrifying memories. Twilight really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault his logic, either: he was doing his best to protect his little Twilight. And that was extended to ensuring a particular memory was left unspoken of. Twilight sighed to herself softly before gently easing out of her quarters, gently treading past Rarity\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\tLike usual, she found Shining Armor already waiting for her at the entrance to the gardens. Also like usual, he was in full guard uniform.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwiley!\xe2\x80\x9d Shining Armor exclaimed upon sighting the young unicorn. He pulled her into a firm hug. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again, little sis. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about your Career Day, but the Commander refused to let me take leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nuzzled her brother affectionately, as soon as she had a moment to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too, big brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining laughed and roughed his sibling\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go visit mom and dad. We can catch up later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight led the way from the gardens to the palace cemetery, picking a few flowers on her way. It was a short walk, and Twilight enjoyed the peaceful silence with her brother. Shining was one of the only ponies she ever felt at ease with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about unwanted advances, or anything. It was just her and Shining, like it always has been. She really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way, either. He brother knew her, the real her, the unicorn who preferred books over real friends (the other Orphans didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count). She could even feel the extra spring in her step, one that Shining noticed and chuckled over. Twilight kept up her carefree manner until, threading their way through many tombstones, the two siblings stood before the two graves that meant more to them than anything at that moment.\r\n\r\n\tAs always, Shining went first. He knelt down upon his forehooves and gently brushed away a stray vine from the first tombstone. It read:\r\n\r\n Night Light Sparkle\r\nHusband and father, may he never be forgotten\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pops,\xe2\x80\x9d Shining began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I\xe2\x80\x99m Captain of the Canterlot Guard. I\xe2\x80\x99m even poised to become the next Commander, as soon as Shattered Wing retires. Against the odds, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. I hope that wherever you are now, you can look down on me and be proud to call me your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight knelt at the face of the tombstone next to her father\xe2\x80\x99s, arranging her flowers as she did so. This one read:\r\n\r\n Twilight Velvet\r\nWife and mother, may she never be forgotten.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGuess what mother? I\xe2\x80\x99m the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e to Princess Luna now. Can you believe it? She saw my eagerness to learn, not just a single branch of magic, but all magic. She promised to start teaching me, and guiding me. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve done you proud, mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m living a dream I never thought would come true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSilence then reigned over the cemetery. Twilight and Shining sat there next to each other, sharing warmth. Neither spoke a word, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Both knew that they had more than lived up to the expectations of their parents. The last of the Twinkle line they may be, but that did not mean they were unworthy to carry on their House name. If anything, they were more determined than ever to become exceptional ponies in their respective fields. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about their parent\xe2\x80\x99s memory. It was about showing the rest of Equestria that they were worthy of being a part of the Twinkle heritage. The first step was to prove they had what it takes. Then, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, Shining finally spoke.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Twiley?\xe2\x80\x9d Shining\xe2\x80\x99s voice was soft, laced with hidden grief.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight turned to her brother in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry? Why would I be angry at you, big brother? You\xe2\x80\x99re the only family I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you should hate me, Twilight. I abandoned you, left to fend for yourself while I followed my dream of becoming a Canterlot Guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly groaned aloud. Her brother was still beating this around the bush? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, Shining, nor do I hate you. I know you wanted to follow your dream, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted you to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo buts, big brother. Okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for you to understand you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being accepted as an Orphan. You were still there for me through the thick and the thin. You were still my rock, my pillar of support when I needed it. Hay, I was the one who told you to follow your dream. So why do you still beat yourself up over this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 feel like a horrible brother. I should have found a job with easily accessible pay. I should have bought us a house to live in. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let me sister live on her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShining, you\xe2\x80\x99re being retarded. Forgive me my language, but you are. There was no reason for you to give up your dreams to \xe2\x80\x98take care\xe2\x80\x99 of a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of living on her own. Or have you forgotten the fact that my foster families learned the hard way not to mess with me? And besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re still missing one detail: Seeing as you are off in the Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m next in line to inherit the Twinkle assets. And I just turned of age yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining Armor stared at his sister for a full thirty seconds before a grin stretched across his muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the inheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight answered a trifle smugly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, not only am I still receiving a stipend from the Crown (which has probably doubled now that I am Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s personal student), I\xe2\x80\x99m inheriting everything our parents left us. And in case you have forgotten this too, our parents left a lot\xe2\x80\x94As soon as I talk to Princess Luna and get it cleared with the realtors and lawyers, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to be the second richest pony in Equestria, after Princess Luna. And if I honestly wanted to, I could start living in the Twinkle mansion. Now, will you please stop beating yourself up over this nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShining grinned ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, okay, you win!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight laughed at that, then began to lead the way out of the cemetery. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, big brother!  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our own duties to return to!"\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash shrugged off her bulging saddlebags and sprawled across her cloud bed, whimpering with relief. Every muscle in her body felt like it was on fire; she had no idea that she could feel this sore, this exhausted. She was already starting to wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99d even make it through her four years of the Wonderbolt Academy. She had been a cadet for barely a day and she was already feeling like she had been a cadet for a year. When Rainbow had applied for the Wonderbolts, Rainbow had an interesting notion of sleek pegasi screaming through the sky, while lesser ponies stared on with awed admiration. To her, the Wonderbolts had been the epitome of adventure and carefree flying, and Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi to be envied.\r\n\r\n\tIt seemed that reality had a harsh wake up call. So far, Wonderbolt Cadets were pegasi who rose before the light of dawn and spent the hour before breakfast partaking in a rigorous course of physical training: galloping, using their wings to lift weights, and balancing upon their hind hooves and walking that way. Already tired from all of this, they had a chance to take a minute, then return to their dormitories, shower with cold water, and then make sure their dormitories were completely spotless. If there was so much as a misplaced speck of dust upon the floor, Soarin\xe2\x80\x99, Wonderbolt second-in-command, would dump the contents of their kits onto the floor, upend their beds, and force them to do it all over again\xe2\x80\x94during the time they should be having breakfast.\r\n\r\n\tBreakfast, naturally, was nothing special\xe2\x80\x94completely basic and barely filling. But Rainbow Dash was used to little breakfast during her personal training days, and so never complained even if she missed breakfast. The other new cadets weren\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and if they missed breakfast, it as a long hard morning until lunch at mid afternoon. And even lunch was only about half an hour long. After breakfast there came three hours of classes for military history, tactical advantages, and so on; these classes were certainly not Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit. She hated anything to do with sitting still for an extended period of time or reading. But she soldiered through them, knowing that she would never become a Wonderbolt if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn all of this important stuff.\r\n\r\n\tThen after these classes, the cadets were required to run an obstacle course before they were allowed to head to lunch. The course was littered with rogue thunderclouds, shifting winds, and freezing patches of water. It also had to be completed in three minutes, and if somepony failed to complete it within that time, they were sent back to the start to try again\xe2\x80\x94often resulting in lost time for lunch. While Rainbow as familiar with sometimes skipping breakfast, or having a sparse one, going without lunch was torture for the mare; as a result, she quickly learned to not make mistakes during the obstacle course.\r\n\r\n\tThen after lunch came even more classes that bored the chromatic pegasus to tears, then a series of aerial challenges designed to put your wings to the test\xe2\x80\x94and even though Rainbow knew she exceeded well here, the challenges were still grueling and always varying. After those exercises, the cadets would form ranks and perform combat drills until the end of the school day, where they had two hours to themselves to unwind a tiny bit, repair gear and prepare for classes the next day\xe2\x80\x94unless somepony earned a demerit during the day. If somepony earned a demerit, all of the cadets were punished. They were ordered to load their saddlebags full of rocks, and then had to complete the obstacle course five times in a row without stopping.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow had just finished one such run. Earlier in the day, one of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s classmates was caught passing a note in Aerodynamics 1, and the instructor, Fleetfoot, confiscated it and read it out to the class: Apparently the pegasus stallion in question was attempting to set up a place for a little\xe2\x80\xa6 tryst\xe2\x80\xa6 with his marefriend after lights out and everypony else was supposed to be asleep. After assuring that there will never be any such activates allowed at the Academy, Fleetfoot had shredded the note and invited the entire class to fill their saddlebags and get to flying. After several snubs directed at the pegasus, the class did as they had been bid.\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash had eventually felt herself pulling away from the rest of them as she rounded the first bend of the course. Even after a single day the strict regime to the Academy was doing wonders for her. Not only was she feeling fitter than she ever had before, but her natural ability as an athlete also came into play. While others had issues with the hairpin turns, dodging rouge clouds and avoiding the water, Rainbow flitted by them with apparent ease, muscles burning for a respite. And in all honesty, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being in front of the proverbial pack. So far, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really gotten a chance to know her classmates really well. She shared classes with them and sweat with them, but still had never really interacted with them. But still, she had shown them. None of the others were even back yet.\r\n\r\n\tNo sooner had she completed this thought that the door at the end of the dormitory crashed open. She propped herself on her elbow and inwardly groaned. Dumbbell, Fast Hoop, and Calamity strode up the rows between the perfectly made beds. They were second year cadets and had decided it was their calling in life to make Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life as miserable as possible. The rainbow flier scrambled quickly to their hooves, but nowhere near fast enough.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in bed, Rainbow Crash? Dumbbell sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be on the course with the rest of your loser classmates. Who do you think you are, that you can just skip instructor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d Fast Hoop and Calamity laughed. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t overly bright, but certainly made up for it with brawn.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow replied tonelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time is my own before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOh yea?\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell got a wicked glint in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call you a liar! Get up from there and give me fifty wing-ups to make me forget about this and not report you to an instructor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow hesitated for a moment. Technically, she was stronger than these three goons. And she knew she was faster, without a doubt. If there was ever a confrontation, she knew she could beat them. But, there was also three of them and one of her. She was not about to take on all three of them at once. Nor was she about to report them to an instructor. If this was how first year cadets were supposed to be treated by higher cadets, then so be it. She\xe2\x80\x99d just have to deal with whatever they threw at her and move on. However, Dumbbell must have seen the light of rebellion in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for a moment.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred wing-ups!\xe2\x80\x9d He ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith a grunt of aching muscles, Rainbow dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups with just her wings. As she began to rise up, she felt a hoof in the small of her back: Calamity had stepped forward, and was exerting just the right amount of pressure to ensure that Rainbow found it hard to complete her assigned task. She grunted again, and Dumbbell yelled at her.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cStop your whimpering, Crash! Move faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow gritted her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to knock Calamity back and jump in with hooves swinging. But the last thing she needed was to be kicked from the Academy. So she soldiered on, determined to do what she was ordered. But it was on her sixth exercise that her wings spasmed, causing her to crash to the floor, stunned. Calamity raised his hoof as though to strike her unprotected back, but was interrupted by a new voice.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her be!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was every bit as tomboyish has Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s, but still definitely feminine. Rainbow and her three tormentors whirled around at the newcomer: a sea green pegasus mare with a two-toned mustard yellow mane. Her topaz eyes surveyed the scene before her disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Dumbbell swaggered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is between me and Crash here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m now making it about me. And if you think you can take on a third year cadet who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing this longer than you, be my guest. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go crying to your mommies when I put you in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow could see the three bullies hesitating. Then, with one last contemptuous look at Rainbow Dash, they stomped out, making sure to give the third year cadet a wide birth. The cadet then approached Dash, who still had not risen. She held out a hoof, with the chromatic flier accepted. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Lightning Dust,\xe2\x80\x9d the newcomer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTop of my class. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one they call Rainbow Dash, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDash stretched her aching wings. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Thanks for that, by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNot a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking to have those three expelled for a while now, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything serious enough to warrant it. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get dinner and see what happens from there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'epub': None}

Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would  start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.\r\n\r\n\tTo be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. Very few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess' eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\tThe princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they can see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on what type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic requiring a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight hadn't even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could feel the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming Nightsteel, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.\r\n\r\n\tLuna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is Grace. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to Grace. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDespite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had wings. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was you summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have wings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThat got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I am real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, force an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly is this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into Grace.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStill partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWell, yes and no.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what's going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard. She\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the truth eventually. And by then, I hope that we will have prepared her as best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure do hope so. I almost couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my expression clear when I first saw her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna echoed Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Starshard. I have too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 'chapter_number': 5, 'parent_chapter_id': 406273, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'5\'></a><h3>Chapter 5 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>\t\tTwilight was excited. Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would&nbsp;&nbsp;start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.</p><p class="indented double">To be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. <i>Very</i> few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess&#039; eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.</p><p class="indented double">The princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they <i>can</i> see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on <i>what</i> type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic <i>requiring</i> a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight hadn&#039;t even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Shining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could <i>feel</i> the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming <i>Nightsteel</i>, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.</p><p class="indented double">Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 <i>Grace</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is <i>Grace</i>. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to <i>Grace</i>. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. <i>Grace</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry <i>Grace</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Despite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had <i>wings</i>. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was <i>you</i> summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>this</i> is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have <i>wings</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">That got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I <i>am</i> real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, <i>force</i> an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly <i>is</i> this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into <i>Grace</i>.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.</p><p class="double"><img src="http://pvpgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/necromancer.png" class="user_image" /></p><p class="indented double">Still partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"><i>Well, yes and no.</i></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what&#039;s going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard. She\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the truth eventually. And by then, I hope that we will have prepared her as best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure do hope so. I almost couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my expression clear when I first saw her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna echoed Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Starshard. I have too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 406273, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E29D50>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'5\'></a><h3>Chapter 5 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>\t\tTwilight was excited. Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would&nbsp;&nbsp;start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.</p><p class="indented double">To be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. <i>Very</i> few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess&#039; eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.</p><p class="indented double">The princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they <i>can</i> see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on <i>what</i> type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic <i>requiring</i> a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight hadn&#039;t even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Shining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could <i>feel</i> the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming <i>Nightsteel</i>, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.</p><p class="indented double">Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 <i>Grace</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is <i>Grace</i>. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to <i>Grace</i>. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. <i>Grace</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry <i>Grace</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Despite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had <i>wings</i>. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was <i>you</i> summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>this</i> is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have <i>wings</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">That got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I <i>am</i> real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, <i>force</i> an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly <i>is</i> this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into <i>Grace</i>.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.</p><p class="double"><img src="http://pvpgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/necromancer.png" class="user_image" /></p><p class="indented double">Still partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"><i>Well, yes and no.</i></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what&#039;s going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard.

Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would  start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.\r\n\r\n\tTo be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. Very few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess' eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\tThe princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they can see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on what type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic requiring a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight hadn't even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could feel the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming Nightsteel, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.\r\n\r\n\tLuna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is Grace. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to Grace. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDespite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had wings. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was you summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have wings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThat got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I am real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, force an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly is this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into Grace.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStill partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWell, yes and no.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what's going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard. She\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the truth eventually. And by then, I hope that we will have prepared her as best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure do hope so. I almost couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my expression clear when I first saw her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna echoed Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Starshard. I have too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 5, 406273, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'5\'></a><h3>Chapter 5 (*)</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>\t\tTwilight was excited. Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would&nbsp;&nbsp;start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.</p><p class="indented double">To be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. <i>Very</i> few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess&#039; eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.</p><p class="indented double">The princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they <i>can</i> see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on <i>what</i> type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic <i>requiring</i> a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight hadn&#039;t even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Shining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could <i>feel</i> the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming <i>Nightsteel</i>, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.</p><p class="indented double">Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 <i>Grace</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is <i>Grace</i>. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to <i>Grace</i>. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. <i>Grace</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry <i>Grace</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Despite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had <i>wings</i>. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was <i>you</i> summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>this</i> is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have <i>wings</i>?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">That got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I <i>am</i> real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, <i>force</i> an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly <i>is</i> this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into <i>Grace</i>.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.</p><p class="double"><img src="http://pvpgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/necromancer.png" class="user_image" /></p><p class="indented double">Still partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"><i>Well, yes and no.</i></p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Now that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what&#039;s going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.</p><p class="indented double">Starshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard. She\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the truth eventually. And by then, I hope that we will have prepared her as best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Starshard sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure do hope so. I almost couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my expression clear when I first saw her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna echoed Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Starshard. I have too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': "//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 5 (*)// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\t\t\tTwilight was excited. Tonight was going to be the first real night of her apprenticeship. The young unicorn had barely returned to her own quarters after the outing with Shining before a page had arrived, telling her to meet Princess Luna in her private study. Hardly able to contain her glee, Twilight had hurriedly made herself presentable and took off back down the corridor. She wondered which branch of magic Luna would teach her first. Each and every branch was important, of course, but she was secretly hoping that Luna would start with Light. Everything about that branch fascinated the bookish mare, from the extremely useful healing spells down to the simplest lighting spell. Or maybe they would start with Nature first, the magic that caused things to grow. Twilight has always wanted a small garden of her own, and maybe Luna would  start with the magic that would make growing one easier. But a small part of her mind whispered that Luna would want to start with Discord magic, throwing a slight damper upon her enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would be able to handle that. A great many uneducated folk insisted that Discord-based magic was evil. Twilight scoffed at the idea, but it was true that Discord magic was\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 not very nice. Animosity, of course, was the opposite of Friendship. The most Twilight knew about it was that it focused on manipulating your foes, deceiving them and preventing them from becoming too attached to you. Animosity was a valued tool for unicorns in Equestria Intelligence, as it was perfect for making sure a spy kept their cover even if enemies knew they were there. Then came Destruction, a magic that took everything Light stood for and obliterated it. Destruction was probably the only branch of magic with so much raw, pure power. Then there was Chaos, a magic that focused on turning reality upside down, and Hatred, which turned your most personal feelings into a tangible weapon. Lastly\xe2\x80\xa6 there was Necromancy.\r\n\r\n\tTo be honest, this was the branch of Discord magic Twilight was afraid of the most. There was so little actually published on the subject. Very few unicorns ever practiced Necromancy, and the ones who did were always closely watched by Princess Luna. It was rumored that bringing the dead back to life was impossible, but if it was, Necromancy would not be able to exist. Twilight was so wrapped up in her own thoughts and worries that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice she had passed the hallway leading to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s study. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until she ran smack into a suit of armor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall being there previously that she realized her mistake. The unicorn backtracked to the correct hallway and proceeded down it, struggling to calm her nerves. Princess Luna knew what she was doing. If she wanted to teach Twilight Necromancy, everything was going to be all right. Twilight knocked gently upon the door to the study.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d came the call.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nudged open the door with a hoof and walked into the spacious room. Princess Luna was seated at the table they had eaten at yesterday, smiling gently at her newest apprentice. For a brief moment, Twilight thought she saw something else in the princess' eyes. But just as quickly it was gone again, leaving Twilight unsure if she had seen it or not. Twilight bowed slightly to the princess.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLuna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waiting for be acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\tThe princess was quick to do so, beckoning her student forward and gesturing to a chair opposite her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Twilight. We have much to start on. I trust that your morning with your brother was satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight jumped a little, surprised at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, eh, yes, it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about your yearly excursions to the graves of your parents. It is one of the things that helps keep you going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was quiet a moment, slightly saddened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does. I only wish they could be here to see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna reached a hoof out to ruffle Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure they can see you now, wherever they are. And I know they would be proud of their only daughter, my faithful student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stared up at Luna, before smiling weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I do my best. For them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cA wise choice. As you may have surmised, today we are going to properly start your training. However, I must warn you that you must also start learning to properly wield a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight looked to her mentor, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cA weapon? What does a weapon have to do with learning magic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral things, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna admonished. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, seeing as I do not want to spoil so many of your lessons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really give you a whole lot of details. But you should know, every branch of magic requires the caster to have some form of weapon. It can be something as simple as a quarterstaff, or as elegant as a glaive. Most mages settle for something small, like a dagger or swortshord, as they only study one particular branch of magic. You are, of course, free to make your decision on what type of weapon you use., yet I would suggest something capable of holding your magic potential. Now, come. We head to my personal armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than a little confused by Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words, the unsure unicorn followed her mentor right back out of the study. They set off down a corridor with a brief pacing, barely even glancing at the guards and servants they passed. Twilight, naturally, was lost in thought. She had never heard of any branch of magic requiring a weapon before. As far as she knew, you just said an incantation aloud (if there was one) and cast the spell. But apparently this was not the case. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly concerned about being subpar with weaponry, however. Growing up with a brother in the guard had meant that Twilight often sparred with him whenever he came to visit, and even sometimes by herself when she was really bored and even her books couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her company. While she has by no means mastered any one weapon, Twilight felt confident she could at least hold her own no matter what she was using.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight hadn't even noticed that she had followed Luna right out of Canterlot castle and into the nearby training grounds, situated almost right smack in the middle of the giant courtyard. She was even more surprised when Shining Armor trotted up in his full guard armor, helmet tucked under one arm. He sketched a quick bow. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna, Twilight. How can I help you two today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually here to pick up a weapon for my student here, Captain Armor. We will be heading to my armory, and I must request that we do not be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShining Armor saluted smartly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my princess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe stallion turned to resume his duties, and Luna led Twilight over to a nondescript building a small distance away. The princess tapped the door with her horn, and the door glowed for a moment before unlocking itself and permitting the two ponies to enter. As they did so, lights flared to life, supplementing the moonlight filtering in through the ajar door. The room itself was rather small, and looked to be more of an arena than anything else. Against the far wall rested a weapons rack that held a wide assortment of weapons. The center space was dominated by a roped off rectangle, while the west and east walls held practice dummies and weapon care utensils. Luna skirted the fighting ring and approached the weapons rack, Twilight following close behind.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I store my most powerful and magical weapons. A few of them I have crafted and imbued myself. Others, I have found in my travels throughout the world. I would like to see if any of these weapons suit you. If they do not, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your brother and see about having a weapon custom made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight approached the wall in slight awe. She could feel the magic radiating off these artifacts. There were a handful of swords of all shapes and sizes. Some quite possibly entirely too big for her, others so small they could probably pass themselves off as knives. A twin pair of axes rested on the lower left corner, while a giant longbow took up the entire right side of the rack. However, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s vision was soon dominated by a weapon that ran through the center of the rack, in all of its beautiful and deadly glory: A glaive. It was easily as long as she was tall while standing on her rear hooves, about four feet. The pole was made of ash and colored lavender, and if one looked closely, they could see the strengthening and durability enchantments upon the wood. The blade was just as impressive, one and a half feet of gleaming Nightsteel, straight and deadly. Near the end of the pole, two scarlet phoenix feathers were attached.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight breathed. That right there was what caught Luna\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Her student was very impressed.\r\n\r\n\tLuna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop a half-smirk from forming upon her lips as she stepped closer to the majestic weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very first weapon I even came close to mastering. I was tired of my sparring partners whacking me repeatedly when we sparred, because I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a weapon I was comfortable with. So I had this forged. I enjoyed the feel of a spear, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like having to stab. I liked the idea of the cutting prowess of a short sword, but it simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the reach I wanted. So, I combined the two and came up with\xe2\x80\xa6 Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d As Luna spoke the name, the glaive rose gently into the air and floated over to the alicorn. It came to a hover directly over Luna\xe2\x80\x99s flat raised right hoof and remained there.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight stepped closer, examining the glaive more closely. Even going by everything that Shining had taught her, Twilight could tell this was a beautiful weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is some very expert craftsmanship. Even the enchantments protecting and making it more powerful meld seamlessly with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cIts name is Grace. Is this the weapon you wish to start with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe unicorn stared at the weapon longingly. For whatever strange reason, the weapon seemed to speak to her. The entire thing seemed to have been specifically tailored towards Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too small, and she was willing to bet it would be perfectly weighted. The pole was even the same color as he fur, for Luna\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight whispered. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she could muster up a higher volume. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tMore than happy to oblige, Luna breathed a slight word to Grace. The glaive left her hoof and meandered over to a specially designed harness, where it fit itself snugly. Smiling slightly, Luna picked the harness up in a flare of obsidian. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s holster came to a rest on Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s right side while straps wound themselves gently around her barrel, keeping the weapon and harness in place. It fit like a hoof glove, completely perfect. Twilight then turned to follow her mentor, who had already left the armory. Behind them, the door clicked shut and locked itself. Then right back up to the castle the pair went, and it was not until they were past the front guards did Twilight realize they had not asked her to relinquish her weapon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Prin--Luna? Should I really be carrying a weapon inside the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna glanced back at her student for the briefest of moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my apprentices, you will find that there are certain regulations that will no longer apply to you. Being armed while in my presence is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be attacked out of nowhere, are we? Is that why I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to carry Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna laughed warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are not going to be attacked. But if we are, it would help if you were already prepared. And besides, remember that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use your weapon in some of the magical teachings.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna entered her study again and sat down at the desk once more, waiting for Twilight to get comfortable.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a great deal of time to decide what branch of magic to start you out with,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna began. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you want to master each of them, but we can still only do one at a time. However, I recalled something that occurred the other day: You seem to be nervous about Necromancy. And so, that is what we are going to start with today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight almost felt herself deflate a little at those words. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, princess? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6 Necromancy should be reserved for unicorns with more practice with magic in general. I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me my faithful student, you are more than ready. I will still be here to guide you, and will help you if it actually turns out you require aid. But the sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner we can focus on other branches, branches that you don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried to stop her voice from shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou start by listening to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna responded with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNecromancy has the potential to be the most complex branch of magic you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever explore. There are a few rules and regulations that need to be followed at all times, which you will quickly discover on your own. Since hardly anypony actually studies this type of magic, and those who do are not allowed to talk about it, Necromancy is naturally steeped in superstitions. I can assure you right now, all of those superstitions you have heard are wholly incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight went wide eyed at this. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d She let the sentence trail off into a question.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you might have heard of Necromancy is likely to be wrong, Twilight Sparkle. When ponies do not understand something, they make up things. They create reasons, excuses as to why something is evil, or something is bad, because it is easier than simply not knowing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 guess that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight frowned dangerously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making stuff up. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather learn about something, instead of just taking guesses at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Twilight, and that is what makes you different from a great deal of my ponies. Now, Necromancy is very hands on. There are no special incantations, like some of other branches of magic. There are only two majorly important things in Necromancy. The willpower of the summoner, and the soul of the summoned. Since you are just now taking your first steps into this magic, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one summoning the soul, so that you can see how it is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tDespite herself, Twilight was curious. Right now it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was Necromancy or not. She was learning, and that was all that was important. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will find out if a Link will be formed, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Link?\xe2\x80\x9d Now Twilight was just plain confused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Link?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna only smiled mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough, my most faithful student. Now, watch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd watch Twilight did. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn suddenly blazed to life, a sickly green tinged with black. As Twilight watched, Luna spoke some more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather easy for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied Necromancy for a long, long time, thus enabling me to summon any soul I wish, even the one I\xe2\x80\x99m not Linked to. What you are about to see will probably startle you, but I implore you to not freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, transfixed by the display. Little motes of energy began falling from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s horn, faster and faster. The princess\xe2\x80\x99 face remained calm, collected. There was no visible strain on her face at all. Twilight marvelled at that fact. She had never seen anypony with so much control over their magic before. Quite soon, however, and Twilight was now preoccupied with something else. A dark mist began to form from thin air, taking on a vaguely pony shape. The mist began to solidify, and just was Twilight began to wonder at its purpose, the mist disappeared. In its place\xe2\x80\xa6 Was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger. Twilight fought back a panicked scream. Her pupils dilated and her breathing began to come faster. It was taking all of her concentration to not just flip out.\r\n\r\n\tDespite her near hyperventilating state, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was doing what it did best: analyzing. The clone of Twilight Sparkle before her was the same, yet completely different. She was lighter, for starters, several shades lighter than Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s own coat and mane coloration. The lookalike also had overly bright eyes, almost shining like a lamp. The figure had started out almost insubstantial, like a ghost, but even as Twilight stared her twin seemed to further solidify, becoming more and more real every moment it stood there. But the thing that stood out the most was the fact that this clone of the original Twilight Sparkle had wings. They were perfectly serviceable, like any other pegasus--or Alicorn.\r\n\r\n\tPrincess Luna finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, Twilight Starshard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe twin turned, her face lighting up in an easy grin. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna! I thought that was you summoning me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. I am teaching my newest apprentice the art of Necromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d The new Twilight turned to glance back at the old one. For the briefest of moments, something flitted across her face. It was like a look of longing. The same look Twilight had thought she saw in Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she entered the study. In the next instant however, Starshard was grinning again, eyes alight with wonder.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is the one meant to be Linked to me! I wondered when somepony would show up. Twilight Starshard, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 Twilight Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, unable to help herself, a veritable flood of questions came pouring from her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWho exactly are you? Why do you look like me? Why do you have wings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard and Luna shared a glance. There was amusement there, but also\xe2\x80\xa6 slight hesitation? Twilight Sparkle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Reading other ponies was not her strong suit.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, I\xe2\x80\x99m Twilight Starshard. As to who I actually am\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess you could call me a physical representation of you, Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA physical representation of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The study of life and death is full of intricacies, and even the most learned Necromancers don\xe2\x80\x99t always pretend to know all of its secrets. Basically\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m an Alicorn who died about a thousand years ago. When Princess Luna summoned me with the intent of Linking me to you, my appearance altered to match your physical makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice became very soft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders slumped a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have been for a great many years, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right there. You look so real!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThat got a warm chuckle from Starshard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I am real. There is one part of the circle of life that is constant: Decision. When a pony dies, he or she has three choices: Rebirth, Revive, Restore. Some call them the three \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99s. Rebirth is a pony who does just that: The are Reborn into some form of undead. This choice is normally taken by ponies who still have unfinished business among the living. Ponies who choose to Revive are reborn into the world of the living from another womb. And ponies who choose Restore cross to the other side, to paradise. I am a pony who chose Rebirth. I came back to life as a Lich Queen, and even though my business within the living world has long been completed, once I became undead, there was no turning back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind was practically running at a thousand miles a minute. She absorbed just enough information to respond: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you are stuck where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I can still help out in the world of the living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight already had another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Lich Queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cA Lich Queen is an undead who controls other undead. Namely, zombies and skeletons. Those guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t usually very smart, so Lich Queens (or Kings) guide them and direct them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\xa6 some ponies are Rebirthed as a zombie? That sounds awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMost sentient creatures rarely Rebirth into something so unpleasant. You see, those types of creatures are the result of a Necromancer breaking the number one rule of this branch of magic. There are two rules a Necromancer must always follow. The first, is that you must never, ever, force an undead being to follow your will. You ask us, and it will be up to the individual undead to decide whether or not to help you in your endeavors. If you try to bend us to your will, not only will we ignore the directive, the Necromancer will degrade into the living dead; what you just called a zombie. If a Necromancer cannot follow this rule, then they do not need to be seeking the aid of unliving. Thousands of years ago, Necromancers made this mistake in droves. They were cocky, overconfident, thinking that all of their vaunted power could not be beaten. They paid the price. But these days, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t so many. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Princess Luna has something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. Even the staunchest of ponies can give in to the lure of power, so I try to keep them away from such a fate as much as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were the size of dinner plates. She had never expected something this momentous \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the second rule of Necromancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link. When its been formed, it cannot be broken for any reason. If a Necromancer tries to remove the Link, the sharing of souls, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the Void. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just cease to exist. No paradise, no Rebirth, no second or third life. Just\xe2\x80\xa6 gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight snorted softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly is this Link you both are talking about? You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it countless times now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Link is a bond shared between the Necromancer and a Soul. When a Necromacner first begins to summon, the first soul he or she summons will be one closest to their genetic makeup. Once that summoning is complete, the undead summoned and the Necromancer will have a choice: They can either form a Link, or they can continue their separate ways and the Necromancer will never try that magic again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it do? Is it just for cosmetic purposes, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard was already shaking her head before the words even left Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you make the decision for yourself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really allowed to. But now that we are at this proverbial crossroads, I must ask, Friherrinna Twilena Star Sparkle av Twinkle: Do you wish to complete the Link? Do you wish to take the very first step in your training as a Necromancer of the Crown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tTwilight was conflicted. On one hoof, this was everything she had feared about the subject laid bare before her. All of the superstitions she had heard were wrong. There was really nothing to be afraid of. But, now an undead Lich Queen was asking her to practically share her soul, if Twilight was hearing that correctly. Her life would never be the same if she accepted. Eventually, however, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s thirst for knowledge easily overpowered her fears of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly, struggling to keep her voice in check.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard, in turn, grinned slightly, like she knew Twilight was going to make this decision sooner or later. Rather than responding to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, Starshard moved closer to Twilight. The suddenly nervous apprentice eyed the Lich Queen warily, but stood her ground. Whatever was going to happen next, Twilight was going to accept it proudly. Starshard stepped even closer, and the finally brought the length of her long, slender horn to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and stubbier one. The effect was immediate. Both let out loud gasps as a strange, unknown energy coursed through their bodies like an electric current. The power grew, and grew, swirling around the pair as they stood there, horns locked. Just as Twilight thought she would burst, the alien power suddenly changed direction--and flowed directly into Grace.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight nearly collapsed as the energy left her, Starshard supporting her gently. They were both panting like they had just ran a marathon. A distant part of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind noted that Starshard was rather warm, instead of the cold feeling she would have expected from an undead. As Twilight recovered, she felt an odd vibrating at her side. It was her glaive. The weapon slide out of its sheath and hovered right before Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, turning so that its owner could see the odd rune in the middle of the staff that had not been there previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStill partially staring at the rune in wonderment, Twilight turned to Luna, silently asking for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIts a Necromancer Rune, Twilight. Its designed to enhance your spellcasting abilities with this branch of magic. Its why I had you obtain your weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Necromancer now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWell, yes and no.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight yelped as she heard a familiar voice echoing around her mind. Luna was grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that? Some form of telepathy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard answered her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a nutshell, yes. Its a part of the Link. Our minds are connected, allowing us to speak no matter how far apart we are. We also have a shared aether pool. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you felt it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Starshard mentioned it, Twilight did feel\xe2\x80\xa6 Stronger. More alive. She could feel the power coursing just below her horn, ready to be unleashed. A small smile began to play across her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m more magically powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your studies in Necromancy are far from over, my faithful student. You have a Link now, that is true. But there is still a great deal to learn. Summoning and controlling lesser undead and a whole host of over things. For now, however, we may call it quits. It is far past lunchtime, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d like to grab a bite to eat before continuing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tNow that Luna mentioned it, Twilight was feeling hungry. Ravenous, even. But there was something still bothering her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about you, Starshard? I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re here now, but what's going to happen from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m Summoned and Linked, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the world of the living for as long as I want, until my Summoner sends me back for whatever reason. Right now, however, I would like the opportunity to catch up to Luna.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight nodded almost absently, her curiosity sated at the moment. With a small wave of her hoof, the lavender unicorn departed.\r\n\r\n\tStarshard waited until the door was closed and she could no longer hear Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoofsteps before turning to Princess Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she suspects anything? Or knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She\xe2\x80\x99s still in the dark. But she won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Twilight is incredibly smart and resourceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met another pony with her drive for knowledge. She even surpasses the last Valkyrie in that regard. She\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the truth eventually. And by then, I hope that we will have prepared her as best we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tStarshard sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure do hope so. I almost couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my expression clear when I first saw her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tLuna echoed Starshard\xe2\x80\x99s sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Starshard. I have too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 'epub': None}

Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from Grace. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, this is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my name is Twilight Sparkle, not \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So you\xe2\x80\x99re the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.\r\n\t\r\n\tWith barely a glimmer from her horn, Grace unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI called you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won't forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually seen Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, Grace sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, Grace held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.\r\n\t\r\n\tThere were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. \r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of Grace. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing Grace parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. Grace was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of Grace to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with Grace beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.\r\n\t\r\n\tOnly to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of Grace and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved Grace and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tIn walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut against three opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So this was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSmiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 'chapter_number': 6, 'parent_chapter_id': 426070, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'6\'></a><h3>Chapter 6</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The first thing Twilight noticed when she stepped into the palace\xe2\x80\x99s Dining Hall were the stares. Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her <i>hadn\xe2\x80\x99t</i> been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from <i>Grace</i>. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, <i>this</i> is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my <i>name</i> is Twilight Sparkle, <i>not</i> \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.</p><p class="indented double">With barely a glimmer from her horn, <i>Grace</i> unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI <i>called</i> you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won&#039;t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually <i>seen</i> Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, <i>Grace</i> sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, <i>Grace</i> held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.</p><p class="indented double">There were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. </p><p class="indented double">The unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of <i>Grace</i>. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing <i>Grace</i> parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. <i>Grace</i> was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of <i>Grace</i> to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with <i>Grace</i> beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.</p><p class="indented double">Only to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of <i>Grace</i> and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved <i>Grace</i> and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.</p><p class="indented double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">In walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut against <i>three</i> opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So <i>this</i> was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.</p><p class="indented double">The zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Smiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 426070, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E29F10>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'6\'></a><h3>Chapter 6</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The first thing Twilight noticed when she stepped into the palace\xe2\x80\x99s Dining Hall were the stares. Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her <i>hadn\xe2\x80\x99t</i> been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from <i>Grace</i>. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, <i>this</i> is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my <i>name</i> is Twilight Sparkle, <i>not</i> \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.</p><p class="indented double">With barely a glimmer from her horn, <i>Grace</i> unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI <i>called</i> you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won&#039;t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually <i>seen</i> Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, <i>Grace</i> sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, <i>Grace</i> held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.</p><p class="indented double">There were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. </p><p class="indented double">The unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of <i>Grace</i>. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing <i>Grace</i> parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. <i>Grace</i> was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of <i>Grace</i> to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with <i>Grace</i> beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.</p><p class="indented double">Only to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of <i>Grace</i> and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved <i>Grace</i> and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.</p><p class="indented double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">In walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut against <i>three</i> opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So <i>this</i> was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.</p><p class="indented double">The zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Smiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ["//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 6// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tThe first thing Twilight noticed when she stepped into the palace\xe2\x80\x99s Dining Hall were the stares. Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from Grace. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, this is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my name is Twilight Sparkle, not \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So you\xe2\x80\x99re the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.\r\n\t\r\n\tWith barely a glimmer from her horn, Grace unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI called you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won't forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually seen Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, Grace sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, Grace held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.\r\n\t\r\n\tThere were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. \r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of Grace. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing Grace parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. Grace was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of Grace to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with Grace beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.\r\n\t\r\n\tOnly to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of Grace and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved Grace and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tIn walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut against three opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So this was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSmiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 6, 426070, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'6\'></a><h3>Chapter 6</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>The first thing Twilight noticed when she stepped into the palace\xe2\x80\x99s Dining Hall were the stares. Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her <i>hadn\xe2\x80\x99t</i> been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from <i>Grace</i>. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, <i>this</i> is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my <i>name</i> is Twilight Sparkle, <i>not</i> \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So <i>you\xe2\x80\x99re</i> the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.</p><p class="indented double">With barely a glimmer from her horn, <i>Grace</i> unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI <i>called</i> you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won&#039;t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually <i>seen</i> Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, <i>Grace</i> sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, <i>Grace</i> held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.</p><p class="indented double">There were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. </p><p class="indented double">The unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of <i>Grace</i>. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing <i>Grace</i> parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. <i>Grace</i> was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of <i>Grace</i> to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with <i>Grace</i> beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.</p><p class="indented double">Only to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of <i>Grace</i> and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved <i>Grace</i> and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.</p><p class="indented double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">In walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut against <i>three</i> opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So <i>this</i> was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.</p><p class="indented double">The zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Smiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Halt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': "//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 6// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tThe first thing Twilight noticed when she stepped into the palace\xe2\x80\x99s Dining Hall were the stares. Some were subtle, others were not, but they were there. She could feel them boring into her form as she crossed the hall towards the heavily laden food carts. However, having great practice at ignoring things that bothered her, Twilight simply pushed this fact to the back of her mind and focused instead on getting something to eat. After all of the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, Twilight was fully prepared to stuff her face until she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move from her spot. Heaping her plate high with her favorite foods, her mind drifted back to a couple of nights ago, when she had been unable to eat. She\xe2\x80\x99d been so paralyzed with fear over something completely silly. And she knew it, too. Of course, just because she knew this now didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that a tiny part of her hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been afraid of being overlooked. Twilight headed towards her usual table without thinking. But as she went to set down her heavily laden tray, Twilight became aware of a few of new additions to the table, not counting the four other orphans who normally sat there.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first one, surprisingly, was Rarity. Why she was all of a suddenly joining the other four orphans after a year of avoiding them was beyond Twilight, but she did have a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with Princess Luna. The other two were both pegasi a little older than Rainbow Dash; judging by their quiet discipline, they were probably from the Wonderbolt Academy. Twilight also took careful notice of the weapons they had brought with them, leaning casually on the wall behind them. One was a large and simple broadsword, designed primarily for heavy combat, definitely sturdy. The other was a metal rod looking contraption Twilight quickly recognized as a lightning caster.Twilight took her spot in the center of the table, making sure her own weapon was going to be fine without having to take it off. Ever since Luna had said actually wearing a weapon was allowed, Twilight hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to stray too far from Grace. For some absurd reason it made her feel safer. Finally, Twilight glanced up to be introduced to the newcomers.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rainbow Dash, who\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting for her fellow orphan to situate herself, did just that. \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, this is Lightning Dust\xe2\x80\x9d-- A teal coated Pegasus with a mustard yellow two toned mane-- \xe2\x80\x9cand Ditzy Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d The last was a grey pegasus with slightly off kilter eyes. Both nodded at Twilight, before Lightning Dust spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re the famed Twilight Sparkle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended a hoof to bump to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Academy in a bit of an uproar these past couple of nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight arched an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lightning Dust shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently you upset quite a few nobles when Princess Luna barely even glanced at their sons and daughters and immediately made for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to cadets whine and complain that their siblings were ignored, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Ditz?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grey pegasus nodded emphatically, proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cYup! Its kind of funny, really. Apparently they thought Twilight would be forgotten, with her parents dead and being the last of her line and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDitzy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rarity exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a rather impolite thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIts okay, Rarity,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was quick to interject, smiling at the bubbly pegasus. \xe2\x80\x9cTruthfully, anything that upsets the nobility is fine by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarity sighed, a bit dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to agree with you there, Darling. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fortunate that my foster family lets me come and go as I please. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t expecting me to become one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s students, but when I did they were quite pleased. Even so, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not really tried to use me as a means to climb up the social ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discussion from there dissolved into the rather pleasant banter that usually accompanied dinner. Twilight found that she was rather liking both Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. The former was almost like Dash in a way, outspoken and wanting to be the center of attention. It was actually kind of funny watching Dust and Pinkie compete to see who could gain everypony\xe2\x80\x99s attention better. As for Ditzy\xe2\x80\xa6 well, she was Ditzy. Twilight had heard talk of the pegasus before, but never would have associated the rumors with the cheerful mare across from her. The way the rumors had it, Ditzy was an insanely clumsy and unapproachable flier who\xe2\x80\x99d rather barbeque you with her lightning caster than look at you. Seeing the mare in the flesh\xe2\x80\xa6 it was hard for the unicorn to believe anything that talk said. But then she mentally scolded herself. What would Rarity say if she knew that Twilight was actually putting stock into mere rumors? The thought caused the unicorn to grin inwardly. Her amusement was cut short, however, as the three cadets at the table froze. They seemed to be staring at somepony behind Twilight. But before the unicorn could turn around, one of the newcomers spoke.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo, this is the table all the losers congregate at, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice immediately made Twilight dislike the speaker. It was rough and barely cultured, and seemed to grate upon the ears longer than normal. Before anything else could be said, a second voice chimed in.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, who said you guys are allowed to carry weapons inside the palace? Especially you, Plum. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have yours leaning upon the wall. Somepony could get in trouble for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dust and Dash looked like they were about tear into the mystery ponies behind them, but Twilight silenced them with a look. She then rose fluidly to her hooves, and in one smooth motion, turned to face the stallions. There were three of them, all brawn and obviously no brains. She cleared her throat a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, my name is Twilight Sparkle, not \xe2\x80\x98Plum\xe2\x80\x99. Secondly, you will find that as an apprentice of Princess Luna, I am perfectly within my rights to conduct my business while armed. Furthermore, seeing as both of those Cadets are accompanying me, I permit them to carry their weapons if they so see fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus before her, who seemed to be the leader of the trio, apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word past her name. \xe2\x80\x9cSparkle? So you\xe2\x80\x99re the tramp Luna decided would make a better mage than the rest of my family!\xe2\x80\x9d The bully practically shouted his sentence to the entire hall to hear, and the area fell silent, eyes boring into the confrontation before them.\r\n\t\r\n\tWith barely a glimmer from her horn, Grace unsheathed itself and came to rest at Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was so cold, everypony else at the table shivered a bit. The stallions before her either didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the danger approaching, or were just too stupid to recognize it.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI called you a tramp. You\xe2\x80\x99re a no-good waste of space who somehow thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s better than one of the most powerful houses in Equestria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third one piped up, obviously wanting to get in his two bits. \xe2\x80\x9cYea! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to threaten us with? A pig sticker? What, too weak to carry a real weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight merely closed her eyes and sighed, a deep sound. She shifted her gaze to some point behind the bullies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Luna? How should I handle this rabble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three pegasi whirled on the spot, staring up in apprehension at Princess Luna, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Twilight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you challenge them to a sparring match outside? Dumbbell, Hoops, and Calamity versus you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the stallions snorted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you serious? Three well trained cadets against one little mare who\xe2\x80\x99s not even a real mage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna surveyed the stallion before her, eyes seeming to pierce his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly serious. If you win, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider taking one of your siblings as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was shaking her head, smiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this one of your ways of testing me, Luna? If so\xe2\x80\xa6 Lets see if I can teach these bullies a lesson in humility they won't forget.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the lavender mare sheathed her glaive and began to thread her way out of the hall and into the courtyard beyond. The other orphans and the two Wonderbolt Cadets followed her eagerly. The entire dining hall fell in step behind them, chatting excitedly. There were more than a fair share convinced that the three seasoned cadets were going to walk all over Twilight, but those who knew that Princess Luna chose her apprentices carefully weren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. Very few had ever actually seen Twilight use her magic. The only thing anyone really knew about the mare was that she spent most of her time with her nose buried in a book.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight was vaguely aware of the other orphans crowding around her, all talking at once. Twilight, however, turned off her ears; they were not important right now. There would be time later to talk to them, but right now, she had to focus. There was very little doubt in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mind that this was a test. Luna had said she wanted to see how proficient Twilight was in actual physical combat. Why exactly Luna wanted to know if she could handle a weapon was beyond the apprentice; undoubtedly having runes emblazoned into an instrument helped, but to her knowledge, most mages didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in melee combat. They stayed at range and rained down spells before an enemy could reach them. But, then again, Twilight very much doubted that Princess Luna was anything like other mages, or masters for that matter.\r\n\r\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves took her to the practice enclosure. It was automatic, as it was the same place her and Shining used to spar in the early early eveing before other ponies were awake to watch them. She strode purposefully to the other side of the square while a giant crowd of spectators came to a stop at the very edge. Word had apparently spread like wildfire, because it looked like every student in the city had come to watch the fight. The thought made Twilight a bit queasy, but once more the lavender unicorn pushed those emotions away. If she could spar against the captain of the guard and walk away relatively unscathed, she was sure she could survive this trial. Of course, her brother was only a single pony; here, she was facing three. Once more, Grace sang as she drew the glaive from its sheath. As she held it in her hooves for a brief moment, the familiar weight of the weapon helped to put her even more at ease. She continued to stare at her new weapon, and something within her mind clicked. She had fought with this weapon before. She knew how to best use it. With utmost precision, Twilight Sparkle reared back upon her rear hooves. Her right hoof came forward and her left foot inched back, and she automatically centered the rest of her body to keep herself balanced. At the same time, her left hoof stretched out slightly in front of her, while her right reached out behind her, Grace held diagonally with the blade thrust above her right shoulder. This further helped improve her balance.\r\n\t\r\n\tThere were more than a few murmurs of astonishment from the watching crowd. Most combative ponies used a combination of their front hooves and their mouths to swing their weapon, while keeping both rear hooves on the ground for stabilization. The three bullies before her on the opposite side of the square, however, merely laughed at her. Apparently they thought she looked rather funny. Twilight ignored their sneers and carefully studied the trio. Dumbbell held a monster of a greatsword. That would give him some impressive reach, but would also slow him down a bit. Hoops was equipped with a pair of small axes; fast attacks, short range, and two weapons to keep track of. Calamity carried the standard mace and shield combination. But then Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s attention was drawn to Princess Luna, who stepped into the center of the ring. She fixed Twilight with a sharp stare. \r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want a nice, clean fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, before sweeping her gaze towards the stallions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna then flapped her powerful wings and rose swiftly into the air, and Twilight took that as an invitation to continue. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe unicorn wasted no time in advancing. She bounded across the ring on her rear hooves, almost like a deer would. The three cadets split up, thinking to hit her from three directions: Front, right, and left. Twilight fell right into the trap, taking another step forward. They were on her in seconds, but instead of the quick victory they had assumed they\xe2\x80\x99d get, they got a faceful of Grace. Twilight moved the polearm easily, parrying the attack of Dumbbell with the blade, sending the massive greatsword screeching off to one side. Hoops then came in, whirling his axes in small circles. Twilight juked to one side, narrowly avoiding one weapon before bringing Grace parallel to stop the second. Calamity ended up backing away swiftly when faced with the butt end of the weapon. Twilight then spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number one: This \xe2\x80\x98pigsticker\xe2\x80\x99 allows me to parry multiple attacks without leaving my guard broken or my sight blinded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe fight then began in earnest. The three bullies systematically attacked Twilight Sparkle over and over again. They seemed convinced that if they kept attacking long enough, eventually she would wear herself down. Grace was a blur as it danced in the mage\xe2\x80\x99s hooves, parrying attack after attack. Parry horizontal. Parry vertically. Catch the edge of that broadsword on the blade. Use the butt of Grace to fend off Calamity\xe2\x80\x99s shield slam. Twirl, two short jabs at offending shield. Twist to stop the broadsword from cleaving her in two. On and on and on, never ending always moving. Twilight felt as though she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in control of her body any more. She was nothing more than a passenger, watching her own hooves as they moved like she had been doing this her whole life.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how long they\xe2\x80\x99d been going at it now. She was caked in sweat, her mane plastered to her forehead. She sported several shallow scratches and cuts, courtesy of not being able to dissipate all of the momentum behind a vicious attack. The three cadets might have been just as tired, but if they were, it was pure determination that still fueled them onwards. As Twilight moved to counterattack after a block, she slipped on a slick patch of grass. Then, all at once, her balance was lost. She fell forward, throwing out her forehooves to stop her downward movement. She landed with Grace beneath her and that dreaded broadsword arching down to meet her unprotected back.\r\n\t\r\n\tOnly to meet a hard mana shield. Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn flared brighter and the shield launched skyward, jerking the blade away from the unicorn. Twilight regained her hoofing, panting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cLesson number two: You should remember that your foe is also a mage, and that magic is as deadly a weapon as a physical one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe three cadets were about finished, now. Dumbbell had anticipating on striking the mare while she was down and ending it all right then and there. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the three cadets were now folding under the annoyed unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s assault. A hard mana shield slammed into Hoops, sweeping the stunned stallion off his hooves. He lay there on the hard-packed earth, the fight beaten out of him. Calamity took one look at the slowly approaching apprentice and fled, dropping his weapons and trying to shove his way out of the crowd of spectators. Dumbbell, however, lived up to his name in more ways than one. He charged at Twilight, rage driven and determined to end the lavender mare who\xe2\x80\x99d caused him so much embarrassment and pain. Twilight was waiting for him. She stabbed out with the blade of Grace and twisted the weapon at the same time, \xe2\x80\x98stinging\xe2\x80\x99 Dumbbell\xe2\x80\x99s hoof and causing him to drop his heavy weapon. Twilight was upon him in seconds, lifting the struggling stallion up with a burst from her horn. Twilight spoke softly and furiously.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLesson three. You would do well to remember that so long as I still take breath into this body, House Twinkle lives. And the last time I checked, House Twinkle outranks yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd with that, Twilight released the cowering cadet. She retrieved Grace and fit it back into its holster, and as she did so, she became aware of the tumult of noise around her. Stunned murmurs and the occasional cheer cut through the air as the weary unicorn turned to find Princess Luna. Her mentor nodded softly at her, indicating approval. Twilight could barely do much more than smile once in return before making her tired way back up to the Dining Hall. She had a dinner to finish, after all.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna sat up in her study when the knock resounded at the door. It was late and most ponies were already in bed, but Luna knew who this was. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tIn walked a weary Twilight Sparkle. The young mare still sported the aftereffects of her little battle. She had been so focused on filling her belly with some sort of sustenance she had flat out refused to go to the hospital wing to get healed. Studying her student silently, Luna decided that it really made Twilight look the part. The Lunar Princess could almost believe that it was the Valkyrie standing there, having just returned from a successful defensive skirmish. Luna mentally shook that image away; there was still a ways to go yet before Twilight was ready for that title and its responsibilities. Luna was the first to speak, already guessing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s first question.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat was your trial in combat, Twilight. I had told you I wanted to see how proficient you were, and the opportunity presented itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut against three opponents? Most others would have fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not, which shows you have far greater strength in you than others know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI almost died, Luna!\xe2\x80\x9d The Lunar Monarch flinched slightly at the raised voice. So this was what was bothering her student. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not for my magic, I would have left this world for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna composed herself; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to show the raw emotion running through her at hearing Twilight so frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be punished accordingly. Dumbbell especially. They were only supposed to defeat you in honorable combat. I had not anticipated them to act so out of hand. It would appear that I made some nobles rather angry, in accepting you as my apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight huffed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment, before finally shifting slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have a bit of a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe princess raised a brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was out there fighting\xe2\x80\xa6 It felt as though I had lost control of my body. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever fought like that before, even against Shining Armor. I knew what to do. How to fight like that. How to keep myself centered. I knew that my odd fighting style would be unpredictable to those unaccustomed to it. Why, Luna? Why do I suddenly have all of this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna had to work to keep her face calm. Twilight was advancing along at an almost frightening pace. Her mind raced, scrambling for something, anything, to tell her student. Finally, she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like I may have to have a word with Starshard about using the Link to influence you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to learn much on your own if she\xe2\x80\x99s helping you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight breathed a slight sigh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was something a little more sinister. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather learn things on my own. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 also sorry for raising my voice at you earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna inclined her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel you were perfectly within your rights to shout at me, Twilight. But, I feel you also learned a valuable lesson tonight, and one that could be very important to your future studies: Never be afraid to involve magic in a fight, even if your opponents do not have any. As you saw tonight, it may save your life. Now. I want you to return to your quarters, and get some sleep. I know you are exhausted, and your training continues tomorrow. While your Link to Starshard was a huge step in your studies of Necromancy, it was also just the beginning. There is quite a bit more for you to learn before you are ready to move on to the next branch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Starshard, anyway? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her at the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has taken up residence in one of the many unused guest rooms this place has. As to why she did not personally appear, I imagine that her appearance would have been quite jarring-- first of all, because she is undead. Though she might mask some of her nature, there are a few who are bound to pick up on it. Secondly, she does look almost identical to you. That right there would cause even more of a stir. Now, off with you, my faithful student. I have yet to converse with my advisors before I may turn in for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight bid her teacher goodnight and left. Mere moments after her departure, another knock sounded at the door, and in walked Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. The Princess smiled.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSpitfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna greeted warmly. The flaming pegasus flashed her trademark grin in response, before tossing herself carelessly into the chair Twilight had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cZecora. Always my eyes and ears, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra chuckled and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes and ears of our Princess we are, EI has our spies wide and far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShimmer. The reason many of us are still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe pegasus blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Luna. All the Corps does is aid recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why we are all the more thankful to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned to the last newcomer, regarding him with twinkling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt. Silver Bit got his nose up his ass again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalter O\xe2\x80\x99Carrick stepped forward, struggling to hide his grin at his Princess\xe2\x80\x99 foul language. Halt never ever smiled. At least, not in all of the hundreds of years Luna has known him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he does. That stupid Sol thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRemind me as to why you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had him locked up, or banished him from Equestria yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire asked.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not really done anything wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lock up a pony just because he wishes that Corona Flare had brought about neverending day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire snorted, which Luna decided to ignore. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know why I\xe2\x80\x99ve called you all here, so lets get this out of the way first, so that we might be able to enjoy a little bit of each other\xe2\x80\x99s company before we have to turn in for the night. Spitfire, you start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire seemed to mull over her next words a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cDash is, hands down, probably the best recruit the Wonderbolt Academy has seen since I graced its halls many many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Everypony in the room gave some sort of exclamation. This was high praise, coming from Spitfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pegasus does things with her wings I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any other pony accomplish. She does exceedingly well with pretty much everything--except her actual classes. While she does get good marks in them, they still bore her. Being such a natural flier means that most of the stuff the instructors are teaching her are nothing new to her. I might end up having to place her in advanced classes, like I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it cautiously, to ensure she does not get too cocky, but I would hazard a guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a full blown Wonderbolt in a year and a half. Maybe less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the normal Wonderbolt training program a total of four years before becoming a full fledged member?\xe2\x80\x9d Shimmer asked.\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show how talented she is, if I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll become a Wonderbolt before I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna rubbed a hoof over her chin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting, but definitely a good thing. What about you, Shimmer? How is young Fluttershy coming along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDespite being extremely shy of even her own shadow, Fluttershy is already the top of this year\xe2\x80\x99s class. She takes to healing very naturally, and being a Whisperer gives her an even bigger edge. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting to work with when she\xe2\x80\x99s really focused. The other night we had a pegasus come through with a broken wing. At the time, Fluttershy was the only medic in the vicinity, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s still only a trainee. When she beheld the injured pony, her entire demeanor changed. She went from being this timid little pony to being assertive, analyzing the situation and gathering information about the accident. She then proceeded to heal the wing faster, and probably better, than most of our senior medics. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a useful asset to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna turned towards Zecora.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe zebra laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pinkamena is a full blown agent in everything but attitude, but even that does not change her aptitude. She has a complete disregard for what is supposed to be impossible, and because of that, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be an agent who\xe2\x80\x99ll be unstoppable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSmiling slightly at the shaman\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes, Luna turned towards the last one. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Applejack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Equestrian Ranger, no doubt about that. But she has a stubborn pride streak almost a mile long, one that even her brother can barely bring her out of. To be honest, that stubbornness could be a potential boon. It\xe2\x80\x99ll mean she\xe2\x80\x99ll be less likely to give up ground when on the losing side of a battle. However, she is quite honest and follows orders well. She\xe2\x80\x99s also quite strong, even stronger than her brother, and her brother seemed like he was born for this kind of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her buck a thick tree clean in two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna let out a thoughtful whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cHmm. Well, it seems as though things are shaping up nicely. If we play our cards right, we just might be able to beat Corona Flare once and for all when she returns. On a slightly similar subject, we need to decide to do with those three cadets of yours, Spitfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBanish them, for all I care.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve suspected those three have been up to no good for a while-- bullying other cadets just because they\xe2\x80\x99re some spoiled nobility brats and are in their second year. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any hard evidence before now. However, shortly after their tussle with Miss Sparkle, three other cadets approached me with concerns about their bullying: First Year Rainbow Dash, and Third Years Lightning Dust and Ditzy Doo. Apparently they decided almost killing your student was reason enough to finally report them for their acts at my Academy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps banishment is just what they need. Whether or not it will be permanent, I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I also must say, I thought for a moment that your student belonged in the Wonderbolt Academy, and not learning under you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna smiled at that. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am quite proud of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tHalt shook his shaggy head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always knew how to pick the strong ones, Luna. Does she know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna was already shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her. Not yet. I will, when she is ready to bear the burden of our mistakes. When she is ready to finally call the other Orphans her friends. But for now, let us forget about the uncertainties of the future, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s company this night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 'epub': None}

Her mane lacked its usual coiffer, instead done up in a tight little bun to ensure it would not get in the way. Normally, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Not since she\xe2\x80\x99s mastered everything about metalsmithing Princess Luna and her forgemasters could teach her. But her presence here was special. Try as Luna might, the Monarch couldn\'t hope to keep her plans a secret when she came to Rarity, asking the talented mare to work her craft once more. Rarity, of course, had been extremely enthusiastic. Not only would she be able to ply her trade, but she was creating equipment for the new Valkyrie. Armor, to be exact, as well of a couple of other things that could prove useful. Armor that just happened to be the right size for Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s own powerful prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. Rarity, for her part, knew exactly who it was for. There was only one student of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s who held the actual title of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, after all. It also helped that Rarity still recalled Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s exact measurements from a couple of years ago. That mare hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grown all that much since then.\r\n\r\n\tDespite what other ponies might think about Orphans in general, Rarity was not stupid. If Luna was grooming a new Valkyrie, after years and years of not having one, something big was going to happen soon. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what, exactly, and even her slight penchant for gossip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cause enough for her to wonder. But she could think of no other pony more suited to the title and all it entailed than Twilight. The studious mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but she was leader material. Rarity knew this without a doubt. The rest of their band of Orphans knew it. Its what had caused them to come together to face an uncertain world that disliked them simply for having the ear of the Princess. Twilight might not want to admit it, but they were all friends. Maybe not close friends, true, but it was there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through so much, and even now they were still sticking together as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\tRarity shook those thoughts from her head and once more focused on her movements, prepping her forge for the task ahead. The metal itself had to be extremely thin, almost impossibly so. The only thing the metal part of the armor would be used for was to give shape to the rest of the structure. Naturally, brightsteel was the only reasonable solution; it could be compressed so thin it resembled a piece of paper, yet could still turn aside even the sharpest of weapons. Over the brightsteel was going to be a layer of compressed magic, allowing ease of movement even if the wearer were not used to the heavy weight of the armor. Then, the last layer was going to be amethyst, mined from the Canterlot mines far beneath the castle itself. This amethyst would then have some of the most powerful enhancements any mage could offer placed upon it. In reality, this armor was going to make its wearer a living fortress. It was designed to be light, with full range of movement. The amethyst would then give it a pleasing color and provide some natural protection against magic and weaponry. Then the enchantments and other protections would further offer defensive capabilities. It was, quite easily, the most daunting task Rarity had ever been assigned.\r\n\r\n\tOf course, this really didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern Rarity. She knew what she was doing. Daunting or not, it would be done to perfection. Deciding that she was ready to begin, Rarity picked up the pieces of brightsteel and held them before her, testing their weight with her magic. These were solid nodes, and would serve her well. She placed all three cantaloupe sized pieces into the forge. She would not use all of them, but what she did not use in the crafting of the armor could be used for other things. With a slight flare of magic from her horn, Rarity fed magic into the fire, causing it to burn three times as hot as before. Normally she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare use magic to speed the process, but doing so would cause the brightsteel to become familiar with the touch of magic, preventing the metal from rejecting it later. So long as she was careful, speeding the process wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mar her work. After several moments and when the metal was a cherry red, Rarity used her tongs to remove the brightsteel from the fiery forge. She then laid the metal on her anvils and, with a practiced series of blows, hammered the metal into large plates that were no more than a half an inch thick.\r\n\r\n\tFinished with each plate, the metalsmith then dropped them into a nearby trough of brine. The unicorn paused in her work once more, and then, mentally determining that the metal had cooled sufficiently, pulled all three oblong sheets from the watery substance. Then the mare produced a block of sandstone from her tool station and proceeded to scrape it against the plates to remove the unpleasant black scales that had formed upon the brightsteel. As she scoured the plates, the crystalline structure of the metal was revealed. Rarity set aside one of the plates of metal and examined the other two; it was imperative that the metal she used was of the highest possible quality, and only by examining the crystals could she ensure that her work could proceed. Deciding that the quality of the metal was as perfect as she could hope for, Rarity moved back over to her forge and superheated the brightsteel once more.\r\n\r\n\tThis time she left them in the flames until the metal was blindingly white, then removed the metal and slapped both pieces down upon her anvils. Hammers pealed in tandem as they struck the metals, creating a musical symphony. Then, on each plate, Rarity made a cut in the middle, folded each piece back onto each other, and welded those pieces together. As the color of the brightsteel began to fade from white to yellow, Rarity again placed them within the forge. Four more times she repeated this procedure, heating the metal and folding it back upon itself. At the end, she could easily bend the precious metal without it tearing; exactly what she wanted in the first place. Next would come the task of actually fashioning the suit of armor, a feat that made Rarity glad she was a unicorn. Even though her training had taught her how to create metal things without magic, like an earth pony, the fact that she could use her magic made things a whole lot easier in the long run.\r\n\r\n\tRarity continued her work for a long time. Once the single piece suit of armor had been finished, it was time to fuse it together with the amethyst. The air practically hummed with magical energy as the metalsmith continued her task. This part was actually quite easy, as amethyst responds well to magic and is willing to change its shape, so long as somepony knows how to handle it. Rarity eventually began to run on autopilot, her magic completing its tasks without her actively thinking about it. Even though she had only done something like this once before in a lesson, thanks to her penchant for details, once was all she needed to recall every step required. Naturally, with her mind having much more free space, it once more began to wander.\r\n\r\n\tUnlike other students within Canterlot were sure to act when they found out, Rarity couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any sort of animosity towards Twilight Sparkle. Sure, being the Valkyrie meant prestige and recognition. It meant the only other pony higher on the chain of command was Luna. But it also meant having hundreds, if not thousands and millions of underlings looking up to you. Expecting you to know what to do no matter the situation. It meant a whole lot of dedication to the Crown, and aiding Luna with the running of Equestria. Rarity didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any of that. It would take far too much out of her if she even tried. It was much easier to be the realm\xe2\x80\x99s most talented metalsmith, than to have so much responsibility thrust upon her shoulders. She could only hope that Twilight would be up for the task too.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy loved her job. Granted, she was not yet a full blown medic, but she knew she was getting there. And just as surely as she felt herself approaching the completion of her training, her shyness was starting to recede. Part of it, she knew, was from the cloak they had given her-- Head Medic Shimmer, that is. A vast majority of the members of the Medic Corps in the field had one; not only did it distinguish them as a healer, it also provided something else: protection from emotions that could cause a field medic to hesitate. Some emotions, Fluttershy had learned, were good. Compassion, for example, was not something negated by those wondrous cloaks. Compassion for a wounded comrade on the field of battle could speed up a medic\xe2\x80\x99s work, make them eager to take care of the patient. Courage was another emotion that the cloak did not foil, and even sometimes gave to the wearer. Courage could allow a medic rush to the aid of those in need while in the heat of battle.\r\n\r\n\tFor some, the cloak blocked emotions like fear-- fear of failure, of not being fast enough. For others, the cloak blocked hesitation. The slightest bit of pause could cost the patient their life. For Fluttershy, however, the cloak blocked a very important thing: Her shyness. Most of the time, without that cloak of office, Fluttershy was her usual painfully shy self. Once she put that cloak on, she was a different mare entirely. She could feel it. She was assertive. She was in control, and her head was clear enough to make solid decisions while working. And what was even better, she was starting to slowly come out of her shell even with the cloak off. And to her eyes, that right there was the best part of her training. It was surprisingly nice to be able to look ponies in the eye and not flinch away, or immediately hide behind her mane.\r\n\r\n\tAt the moment, Fluttershy was the medic on duty at the front of the main hospital the Medic Corps were stationed at. Why they called it a hospital, Fluttershy was not entirely sure. The towering building was more like an army headquarters that just so happened to have hundreds of rooms to hold patients. Ordinarily, Fluttershy might have questioned why she was the only healer on duty in the reception area; should a patient suddenly be admitted, it would be up to Fluttershy to take care of them, see if they could be healed, and have a room prepared for them if they needed to stay a while. But, Fluttershy knew that Head Medic Shimmer had faith in her. If Shimmer decided that the buttery pegasus was capable of being at this particular post, then Fluttershy would stay here until she was relieved. She was not about to let her mentor down.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s ears quirked, snapping to attention. All was silent. She had thought, for the briefest of moments, she had heard a siren. She strained her ears, trying to catch the elusive sound again. The emergency dispatch teams were the members of the Corps out in the city, at numerous smaller bases. Each member of the EDT carried special magic infused gems, that, when activated, flashed blue and red and emitted a shrill warbling. It warned ponies to clear a path to the closest hospital for the EDTs to take. About the time Fluttershy had decided she had imagined it, the sound came again, and this time stayed. It was faint still, but growing louder by the minute. Fluttershy trotted over to the massive double doors and shoved them open, magical clasps keeping them that way. Then, she waited. There was only one hospital in this area of Canterlot, after all.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy saw the flashing lights far before the EDT came into view, bouncing off of buildings and lightning up the night sky.The wailing sirens grew to a crescendo of sound, nearly deafening the pegasus. Then the EDT appeared, six earth ponies strong, bearing a stretcher with something on it. The bright lights made it hard for Fluttershy to see what. The six earth ponies skidded to a halt in front of the pegasus, blowing hard, and the sirens mercifully stopped. Without wasting a moment of time, Fluttershy approached the team to see exactly what she was up against. One of the earth ponies, the captain of this unit judging by her short cloak, noticed Fluttershy approaching and spoke, heaving great breaths as she did so.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGiant club fire--down in Night District. Numerous-- were wounded, but this one-- was too severely burned-- for the hospitals down there to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy barely heard the words, staring past the captain with a dawning sense of horror. The pony on the stretcher was so badly burned that at first, Fluttershy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell it was a mare or a stallion. Upon closer inspection, the medic in training determined this was a mare, as her features-- what little of them had not been burned-- were less blocky than a stallion\xe2\x80\x99s. Aside from that, and the horn protruding from the mare\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, there was almost nothing remaining to identify who this mare was. What was left of her main and tail was covered in soot. Her coat and cutie mark was a mystery with all of those burns. The only other thing that could have identified the unicorn was a melted mess of purple colored plastic perched upon her nose, that might have been a pair of fashion glasses at one point in time. The mare, to Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, was still breathing, but even she could tell it was weak and harsh.\r\n\r\n\tEven as the medic took all of these details in, her cloak was working to neutralize the horror freezing her in place. In control of her limbs once again, Fluttershy rushed to the burn victim to begin her analysis. Luckily, the unicorn did not seem to be wearing any clothing. This was a good thing, as it would make her treatment much easier later on. The only thing that would pose a problem was the melted plastic stuck to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle, but that was something that could be taken care of later. From within her ever present satchel Fluttershy withdrew a long, thin tube. She gently prized open the victim\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and fed the tube inside; this would allow medics to use a small ventilator to help the air passageway to remain open. Sticking the other end of the tube into her mouth, Fluttershy blew air into the tube slowly. Judging by the slightly stronger breaths the unicorn was now taking, her airways were clearer.\r\n\r\n\tShe motioned to the exhausted emergency dispatch team and they began to move inside the hospital. Several other medics met them, having heard the sirens and flashing lights. They joined Fluttershy on either side of the patient, checking for severe shock and other complications. Aside from being unconscious, the burned mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be suffering from shock, but it never hurt to be sure. The medic in training led her small posse directly to the burn center, where real treatment of the mare could commence. Fluttershy had done all she could by ensuring that the unicorn could still breathe, but the rest was beyond her capabilities. The victim would have to be injected with fluids, to replace those lost and to make sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into shock. Then she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be placed in one of those special burn tanks, while doctors and surgeons set about the task of healing her and regrowing her body. Deciding that the unknown unicorn was in good hooves, Fluttershy decided it would be a good idea to return to her post.\r\n\r\n\tInstead, as she turned around, she came face to face with Shimmer. Fluttershy meeped, startled. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Head Medic. I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Her accursed shyness was returning, despite the cloak\xe2\x80\x99s effort to dispel the emotion.\r\n\r\n\tShimmer was smiling gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to be afraid, Fluttershy. And I certainly did not mean to startle you. You did well, with that mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy perked up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer nodded once. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did. You remembered your training, and because of you, that mare is likely to live to see another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Head Medic\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice blushed at the praise. \xe2\x80\x9cI, um, I just did what I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, you just acted. And, in light of this, I think it is time we start the next phrase of your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, um\xe2\x80\xa6 advanced training? Or something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you could call it that. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start teaching you the art of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus squeaked at that. \xe2\x80\x9cC-Combat? But I don\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Fluttershy. It is time I taught you how to fight. We Medics cannot always rely on our comrades to protect us while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the battlefield, doing our jobs. The Medic Corps have their own style of fighting, one that has served us well. For we do not fight with weapons, dear Fluttershy. We fight with utensils. Mixtures designed to confuse and incapacitate a foe."\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cO--Oh. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s better than fighting with weapons, and killing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we don\xe2\x80\x99t fight to kill! We save lives, not take them. Report to my office early tomorrow morning, and we shall begin. You are dismissed, Trainee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith only a small nod towards her mentor, Fluttershy retreated towards the front doors. The walk to her foster parent\xe2\x80\x99s house was full of thoughts about what Shimmer had just told her.\r\n', 'chapter_number': 7, 'parent_chapter_id': 438032, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'7\'></a><h3>Chapter 7</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>In one of Canterlot Castle\xe2\x80\x99s many private forges, a marshmallow mare was preparing to be hard at work. Her mane lacked its usual coiffer, instead done up in a tight little bun to ensure it would not get in the way. Normally, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Not since she\xe2\x80\x99s mastered everything about metalsmithing Princess Luna and her forgemasters could teach her. But her presence here was special. Try as Luna might, the Monarch couldn&#039;t hope to keep her plans a secret when she came to Rarity, asking the talented mare to work her craft once more. Rarity, of course, had been extremely enthusiastic. Not only would she be able to ply her trade, but she was creating <i>equipment</i> for the new Valkyrie. Armor, to be exact, as well of a couple of other things that could prove useful. Armor that just happened to be the right size for Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s own powerful prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. Rarity, for her part, knew exactly <i>who</i> it was for. There was only one student of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s who held the actual title of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, after all. It also helped that Rarity still recalled Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s exact measurements from a couple of years ago. That mare hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grown all that much since then.</p><p class="indented double">Despite what other ponies might think about Orphans in general, Rarity was not stupid. If Luna was grooming a new Valkyrie, after years and years of not having one, something <i>big</i> was going to happen soon. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what, exactly, and even her slight penchant for gossip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cause enough for her to wonder. But she could think of no other pony more suited to the title and all it entailed than Twilight. The studious mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but she was leader material. Rarity knew this without a doubt. The rest of their band of Orphans knew it. Its what had caused them to come together to face an uncertain world that disliked them simply for having the ear of the Princess. Twilight might not want to admit it, but they were all friends. Maybe not close friends, true, but it was there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through so much, and even now they were still sticking together as much as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Rarity shook those thoughts from her head and once more focused on her movements, prepping her forge for the task ahead. The metal itself had to be extremely thin, almost impossibly so. The only thing the metal part of the armor would be used for was to give shape to the rest of the structure. Naturally, <i>brightsteel</i> was the only reasonable solution; it could be compressed so thin it resembled a piece of paper, yet could still turn aside even the sharpest of weapons. Over the <i>brightsteel</i> was going to be a layer of compressed magic, allowing ease of movement even if the wearer were not used to the heavy weight of the armor. Then, the last layer was going to be amethyst, mined from the Canterlot mines far beneath the castle itself. This amethyst would then have some of the most powerful enhancements any mage could offer placed upon it. In reality, this armor was going to make its wearer a living fortress. It was designed to be light, with full range of movement. The amethyst would then give it a pleasing color and provide some natural protection against magic and weaponry.

The medic in training led her small posse directly to the burn center, where real treatment of the mare could commence. Fluttershy had done all she could by ensuring that the unicorn could still breathe, but the rest was beyond her capabilities. The victim would have to be injected with fluids, to replace those lost and to make sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into shock. Then she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be placed in one of those special burn tanks, while doctors and surgeons set about the task of healing her and regrowing her body. Deciding that the unknown unicorn was in good hooves, Fluttershy decided it would be a good idea to return to her post.</p><p class="indented double">Instead, as she turned around, she came face to face with Shimmer. Fluttershy meeped, startled. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Head Medic. I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Her accursed shyness was returning, despite the cloak\xe2\x80\x99s effort to dispel the emotion.</p><p class="indented double">Shimmer was smiling gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to be afraid, Fluttershy. And I certainly did not mean to startle you. You did well, with that mare.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy perked up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shimmer nodded once. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did. You remembered your training, and because of you, that mare is likely to live to see another day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Head Medic\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice blushed at the praise. \xe2\x80\x9cI, um, I just did what I could.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, you just acted. And, in light of this, I think it is time we start the next phrase of your training.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, um\xe2\x80\xa6 advanced training? Or something?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you could call it that. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start teaching you the art of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The pegasus squeaked at that. \xe2\x80\x9cC-Combat?

We Medics cannot always rely on our comrades to protect us while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the battlefield, doing our jobs. The Medic Corps have their own style of fighting, one that has served us well. For we do not fight with weapons, dear Fluttershy. We fight with utensils. Mixtures designed to confuse and incapacitate a foe.&quot;</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cO--Oh. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s better than fighting with weapons, and killing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Shimmer shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we don\xe2\x80\x99t fight to kill!

You are dismissed, Trainee.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">With only a small nod towards her mentor, Fluttershy retreated towards the front doors.

Her mane lacked its usual coiffer, instead done up in a tight little bun to ensure it would not get in the way. Normally, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Not since she\xe2\x80\x99s mastered everything about metalsmithing Princess Luna and her forgemasters could teach her. But her presence here was special. Try as Luna might, the Monarch couldn&#039;t hope to keep her plans a secret when she came to Rarity, asking the talented mare to work her craft once more. Rarity, of course, had been extremely enthusiastic. Not only would she be able to ply her trade, but she was creating <i>equipment</i> for the new Valkyrie. Armor, to be exact, as well of a couple of other things that could prove useful. Armor that just happened to be the right size for Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s own powerful prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. Rarity, for her part, knew exactly <i>who</i> it was for. There was only one student of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s who held the actual title of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, after all. It also helped that Rarity still recalled Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s exact measurements from a couple of years ago. That mare hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grown all that much since then.</p><p class="indented double">Despite what other ponies might think about Orphans in general, Rarity was not stupid. If Luna was grooming a new Valkyrie, after years and years of not having one, something <i>big</i> was going to happen soon. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what, exactly, and even her slight penchant for gossip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cause enough for her to wonder. But she could think of no other pony more suited to the title and all it entailed than Twilight. The studious mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but she was leader material. Rarity knew this without a doubt. The rest of their band of Orphans knew it. Its what had caused them to come together to face an uncertain world that disliked them simply for having the ear of the Princess. Twilight might not want to admit it, but they were all friends. Maybe not close friends, true, but it was there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through so much, and even now they were still sticking together as much as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Rarity shook those thoughts from her head and once more focused on her movements, prepping her forge for the task ahead. The metal itself had to be extremely thin, almost impossibly so. The only thing the metal part of the armor would be used for was to give shape to the rest of the structure. Naturally, <i>brightsteel</i> was the only reasonable solution; it could be compressed so thin it resembled a piece of paper, yet could still turn aside even the sharpest of weapons. Over the <i>brightsteel</i> was going to be a layer of compressed magic, allowing ease of movement even if the wearer were not used to the heavy weight of the armor. Then, the last layer was going to be amethyst, mined from the Canterlot mines far beneath the castle itself. This amethyst would then have some of the most powerful enhancements any mage could offer placed upon it. In reality, this armor was going to make its wearer a living fortress. It was designed to be light, with full range of movement. The amethyst would then give it a pleasing color and provide some natural protection against magic and weaponry. Then the enchantments and other protections would further offer defensive capabilities. It was, quite easily, the most daunting task Rarity had ever been assigned.</p><p class="indented double">Of course, this really didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern Rarity. She knew what she was doing. Daunting or not, it would be done to perfection. Deciding that she was ready to begin, Rarity picked up the pieces of <i>brightsteel</i> and held them before her, testing their weight with her magic. These were solid nodes, and would serve her well. She placed all three cantaloupe sized pieces into the forge. She would not use all of them, but what she did not use in the crafting of the armor could be used for other things. With a slight flare of magic from her horn, Rarity fed magic into the fire, causing it to burn three times as hot as before. Normally she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare use magic to speed the process, but doing so would cause the <i>brightsteel</i> to become familiar with the touch of magic, preventing the metal from rejecting it later. So long as she was careful, speeding the process wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mar her work. After several moments and when the metal was a cherry red, Rarity used her tongs to remove the <i>brightsteel</i> from the fiery forge. She then laid the metal on her anvils and, with a practiced series of blows, hammered the metal into large plates that were no more than a half an inch thick.</p><p class="indented double">Finished with each plate, the metalsmith then dropped them into a nearby trough of brine. The unicorn paused in her work once more, and then, mentally determining that the metal had cooled sufficiently, pulled all three oblong sheets from the watery substance. Then the mare produced a block of sandstone from her tool station and proceeded to scrape it against the plates to remove the unpleasant black scales that had formed upon the <i>brightsteel</i>. As she scoured the plates, the crystalline structure of the metal was revealed. Rarity set aside one of the plates of metal and examined the other two; it was imperative that the metal she used was of the highest possible quality, and only by examining the crystals could she ensure that her work could proceed. Deciding that the quality of the metal was as perfect as she could hope for, Rarity moved back over to her forge and superheated the <i>brightsteel</i> once more.</p><p class="indented double">This time she left them in the flames until the metal was blindingly white, then removed the metal and slapped both pieces down upon her anvils. Hammers pealed in tandem as they struck the metals, creating a musical symphony. Then, on each plate, Rarity made a cut in the middle, folded each piece back onto each other, and welded those pieces together. As the color of the <i>brightsteel</i> began to fade from white to yellow, Rarity again placed them within the forge. Four more times she repeated this procedure, heating the metal and folding it back upon itself. At the end, she could easily bend the precious metal without it tearing; exactly what she wanted in the first place. Next would come the task of actually fashioning the suit of armor, a feat that made Rarity glad she was a unicorn. Even though her training had taught her how to create metal things without magic, like an earth pony, the fact that she could use her magic made things a whole lot easier in the long run.</p><p class="indented double">Rarity continued her work for a long time. Once the single piece suit of armor had been finished, it was time to fuse it together with the amethyst. The air practically hummed with magical energy as the metalsmith continued her task. This part was actually quite easy, as amethyst responds well to magic and is willing to change its shape, so long as somepony knows how to handle it. Rarity eventually began to run on autopilot, her magic completing its tasks without her actively thinking about it. Even though she had only done something like this once before in a lesson, thanks to her penchant for details, once was all she needed to recall every step required. Naturally, with her mind having much more free space, it once more began to wander.</p><p class="indented double">Unlike other students within Canterlot were sure to act when they found out, Rarity couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any sort of animosity towards Twilight Sparkle. Sure, being the Valkyrie meant prestige and recognition. It meant the only other pony higher on the chain of command was Luna. But it also meant having hundreds, if not thousands and millions of underlings looking up to you. Expecting you to know what to do no matter the situation. It meant a whole lot of dedication to the Crown, and aiding Luna with the running of Equestria. Rarity didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any of that. It would take far too much out of her if she even tried. It was much easier to be the realm\xe2\x80\x99s most talented metalsmith, than to have so much responsibility thrust upon her shoulders. She could only hope that Twilight would be up for the task too.</p><p class="double"></p><p><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p></p><br /><p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy loved her job. Granted, she was not yet a full blown medic, but she knew she was getting there. And just as surely as she felt herself approaching the completion of her training, her shyness was starting to recede. Part of it, she knew, was from the cloak they had given her-- Head Medic Shimmer, that is. A vast majority of the members of the Medic Corps in the field had one; not only did it distinguish them as a healer, it also provided something else: protection from emotions that could cause a field medic to hesitate. Some emotions, Fluttershy had learned, were good. Compassion, for example, was not something negated by those wondrous cloaks. Compassion for a wounded comrade on the field of battle could speed up a medic\xe2\x80\x99s work, make them eager to take care of the patient. Courage was another emotion that the cloak did not foil, and even sometimes gave to the wearer. Courage could allow a medic rush to the aid of those in need while in the heat of battle.</p><p class="indented double">For some, the cloak blocked emotions like fear-- fear of failure, of not being fast enough. For others, the cloak blocked hesitation. The slightest bit of pause could cost the patient their life. For Fluttershy, however, the cloak blocked a very important thing: Her shyness. Most of the time, without that cloak of office, Fluttershy was her usual painfully shy self. Once she put that cloak on, she was a different mare entirely. She could feel it. She was assertive. She was in control, and her head was clear enough to make solid decisions while working. And what was even better, she was starting to slowly come out of her shell even with the cloak off. And to her eyes, that right there was the best part of her training. It was surprisingly nice to be able to look ponies in the eye and not flinch away, or immediately hide behind her mane.</p><p class="indented double">At the moment, Fluttershy was the medic on duty at the front of the main hospital the Medic Corps were stationed at. Why they called it a hospital, Fluttershy was not entirely sure. The towering building was more like an army headquarters that just so happened to have hundreds of rooms to hold patients. Ordinarily, Fluttershy might have questioned <i>why</i> she was the only healer on duty in the reception area; should a patient suddenly be admitted, it would be up to Fluttershy to take care of them, see if they could be healed, and have a room prepared for them if they needed to stay a while. But, Fluttershy knew that Head Medic Shimmer had faith in her. If Shimmer decided that the buttery pegasus was capable of being at this particular post, then Fluttershy would stay here until she was relieved. She was not about to let her mentor down.</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s ears quirked, snapping to attention. All was silent. She had thought, for the briefest of moments, she had heard a siren. She strained her ears, trying to catch the elusive sound again. The emergency dispatch teams were the members of the Corps out in the city, at numerous smaller bases. Each member of the EDT carried special magic infused gems, that, when activated, flashed blue and red and emitted a shrill warbling. It warned ponies to clear a path to the closest hospital for the EDTs to take. About the time Fluttershy had decided she had imagined it, the sound came again, and this time stayed. It was faint still, but growing louder by the minute. Fluttershy trotted over to the massive double doors and shoved them open, magical clasps keeping them that way. Then, she waited. There was only one hospital in this area of Canterlot, after all.</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy saw the flashing lights far before the EDT came into view, bouncing off of buildings and lightning up the night sky.The wailing sirens grew to a crescendo of sound, nearly deafening the pegasus. Then the EDT appeared, six earth ponies strong, bearing a stretcher with <i>something</i> on it. The bright lights made it hard for Fluttershy to see what. The six earth ponies skidded to a halt in front of the pegasus, blowing hard, and the sirens mercifully stopped. Without wasting a moment of time, Fluttershy approached the team to see exactly what she was up against. One of the earth ponies, the captain of this unit judging by her short cloak, noticed Fluttershy approaching and spoke, heaving great breaths as she did so.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGiant club fire--down in Night District. Numerous-- were wounded, but this one-- was too severely burned-- for the hospitals down there to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy barely heard the words, staring past the captain with a dawning sense of horror. The pony on the stretcher was so badly burned that at first, Fluttershy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell it was a mare or a stallion. Upon closer inspection, the medic in training determined this was a mare, as her features-- what little of them had not been burned-- were less blocky than a stallion\xe2\x80\x99s. Aside from that, and the horn protruding from the mare\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, there was almost nothing remaining to identify who this mare was. What was left of her main and tail was covered in soot. Her coat and cutie mark was a mystery with all of those burns. The only other thing that could have identified the unicorn was a melted mess of purple colored plastic perched upon her nose, that might have been a pair of fashion glasses at one point in time. The mare, to Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, was still breathing, but even she could tell it was weak and harsh.</p><p class="indented double">Even as the medic took all of these details in, her cloak was working to neutralize the horror freezing her in place. In control of her limbs once again, Fluttershy rushed to the burn victim to begin her analysis. Luckily, the unicorn did not seem to be wearing any clothing. This was a good thing, as it would make her treatment much easier later on. The only thing that would pose a problem was the melted plastic stuck to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle, but that was something that could be taken care of later. From within her ever present satchel Fluttershy withdrew a long, thin tube. She gently prized open the victim\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and fed the tube inside; this would allow medics to use a small ventilator to help the air passageway to remain open. Sticking the other end of the tube into her mouth, Fluttershy blew air into the tube slowly. Judging by the slightly stronger breaths the unicorn was now taking, her airways were clearer.</p><p class="indented double">She motioned to the exhausted emergency dispatch team and they began to move inside the hospital. Several other medics met them, having heard the sirens and flashing lights. They joined Fluttershy on either side of the patient, checking for severe shock and other complications. Aside from being unconscious, the burned mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be suffering from shock, but it never hurt to be sure. The medic in training led her small posse directly to the burn center, where real treatment of the mare could commence.

Once the single piece suit of armor had been finished, it was time to fuse it together with the amethyst. The air practically hummed with magical energy as the metalsmith continued her task. This part was actually quite easy, as amethyst responds well to magic and is willing to change its shape, so long as somepony knows how to handle it. Rarity eventually began to run on autopilot, her magic completing its tasks without her actively thinking about it. Even though she had only done something like this once before in a lesson, thanks to her penchant for details, once was all she needed to recall every step required. Naturally, with her mind having much more free space, it once more began to wander.\r\n\r\n\tUnlike other students within Canterlot were sure to act when they found out, Rarity couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any sort of animosity towards Twilight Sparkle. Sure, being the Valkyrie meant prestige and recognition. It meant the only other pony higher on the chain of command was Luna. But it also meant having hundreds, if not thousands and millions of underlings looking up to you. Expecting you to know what to do no matter the situation. It meant a whole lot of dedication to the Crown, and aiding Luna with the running of Equestria. Rarity didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any of that. It would take far too much out of her if she even tried. It was much easier to be the realm\xe2\x80\x99s most talented metalsmith, than to have so much responsibility thrust upon her shoulders. She could only hope that Twilight would be up for the task too.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy loved her job. Granted, she was not yet a full blown medic, but she knew she was getting there. And just as surely as she felt herself approaching the completion of her training, her shyness was starting to recede. Part of it, she knew, was from the cloak they had given her-- Head Medic Shimmer, that is. A vast majority of the members of the Medic Corps in the field had one; not only did it distinguish them as a healer, it also provided something else: protection from emotions that could cause a field medic to hesitate. Some emotions, Fluttershy had learned, were good. Compassion, for example, was not something negated by those wondrous cloaks. Compassion for a wounded comrade on the field of battle could speed up a medic\xe2\x80\x99s work, make them eager to take care of the patient. Courage was another emotion that the cloak did not foil, and even sometimes gave to the wearer. Courage could allow a medic rush to the aid of those in need while in the heat of battle.\r\n\r\n\tFor some, the cloak blocked emotions like fear-- fear of failure, of not being fast enough. For others, the cloak blocked hesitation. The slightest bit of pause could cost the patient their life. For Fluttershy, however, the cloak blocked a very important thing: Her shyness. Most of the time, without that cloak of office, Fluttershy was her usual painfully shy self. Once she put that cloak on, she was a different mare entirely. She could feel it. She was assertive. She was in control, and her head was clear enough to make solid decisions while working. And what was even better, she was starting to slowly come out of her shell even with the cloak off. And to her eyes, that right there was the best part of her training. It was surprisingly nice to be able to look ponies in the eye and not flinch away, or immediately hide behind her mane.\r\n\r\n\tAt the moment, Fluttershy was the medic on duty at the front of the main hospital the Medic Corps were stationed at. Why they called it a hospital, Fluttershy was not entirely sure. The towering building was more like an army headquarters that just so happened to have hundreds of rooms to hold patients. Ordinarily, Fluttershy might have questioned why she was the only healer on duty in the reception area; should a patient suddenly be admitted, it would be up to Fluttershy to take care of them, see if they could be healed, and have a room prepared for them if they needed to stay a while. But, Fluttershy knew that Head Medic Shimmer had faith in her. If Shimmer decided that the buttery pegasus was capable of being at this particular post, then Fluttershy would stay here until she was relieved. She was not about to let her mentor down.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s ears quirked, snapping to attention. All was silent. She had thought, for the briefest of moments, she had heard a siren. She strained her ears, trying to catch the elusive sound again. The emergency dispatch teams were the members of the Corps out in the city, at numerous smaller bases. Each member of the EDT carried special magic infused gems, that, when activated, flashed blue and red and emitted a shrill warbling. It warned ponies to clear a path to the closest hospital for the EDTs to take. About the time Fluttershy had decided she had imagined it, the sound came again, and this time stayed. It was faint still, but growing louder by the minute. Fluttershy trotted over to the massive double doors and shoved them open, magical clasps keeping them that way. Then, she waited. There was only one hospital in this area of Canterlot, after all.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy saw the flashing lights far before the EDT came into view, bouncing off of buildings and lightning up the night sky.The wailing sirens grew to a crescendo of sound, nearly deafening the pegasus. Then the EDT appeared, six earth ponies strong, bearing a stretcher with something on it. The bright lights made it hard for Fluttershy to see what. The six earth ponies skidded to a halt in front of the pegasus, blowing hard, and the sirens mercifully stopped. Without wasting a moment of time, Fluttershy approached the team to see exactly what she was up against. One of the earth ponies, the captain of this unit judging by her short cloak, noticed Fluttershy approaching and spoke, heaving great breaths as she did so.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGiant club fire--down in Night District. Numerous-- were wounded, but this one-- was too severely burned-- for the hospitals down there to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy barely heard the words, staring past the captain with a dawning sense of horror. The pony on the stretcher was so badly burned that at first, Fluttershy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell it was a mare or a stallion. Upon closer inspection, the medic in training determined this was a mare, as her features-- what little of them had not been burned-- were less blocky than a stallion\xe2\x80\x99s. Aside from that, and the horn protruding from the mare\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, there was almost nothing remaining to identify who this mare was. What was left of her main and tail was covered in soot. Her coat and cutie mark was a mystery with all of those burns. The only other thing that could have identified the unicorn was a melted mess of purple colored plastic perched upon her nose, that might have been a pair of fashion glasses at one point in time. The mare, to Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, was still breathing, but even she could tell it was weak and harsh.\r\n\r\n\tEven as the medic took all of these details in, her cloak was working to neutralize the horror freezing her in place. In control of her limbs once again, Fluttershy rushed to the burn victim to begin her analysis. Luckily, the unicorn did not seem to be wearing any clothing. This was a good thing, as it would make her treatment much easier later on. The only thing that would pose a problem was the melted plastic stuck to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle, but that was something that could be taken care of later. From within her ever present satchel Fluttershy withdrew a long, thin tube. She gently prized open the victim\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and fed the tube inside; this would allow medics to use a small ventilator to help the air passageway to remain open. Sticking the other end of the tube into her mouth, Fluttershy blew air into the tube slowly. Judging by the slightly stronger breaths the unicorn was now taking, her airways were clearer.\r\n\r\n\tShe motioned to the exhausted emergency dispatch team and they began to move inside the hospital. Several other medics met them, having heard the sirens and flashing lights. They joined Fluttershy on either side of the patient, checking for severe shock and other complications. Aside from being unconscious, the burned mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be suffering from shock, but it never hurt to be sure. The medic in training led her small posse directly to the burn center, where real treatment of the mare could commence. Fluttershy had done all she could by ensuring that the unicorn could still breathe, but the rest was beyond her capabilities. The victim would have to be injected with fluids, to replace those lost and to make sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into shock. Then she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be placed in one of those special burn tanks, while doctors and surgeons set about the task of healing her and regrowing her body. Deciding that the unknown unicorn was in good hooves, Fluttershy decided it would be a good idea to return to her post.\r\n\r\n\tInstead, as she turned around, she came face to face with Shimmer. Fluttershy meeped, startled. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Head Medic. I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Her accursed shyness was returning, despite the cloak\xe2\x80\x99s effort to dispel the emotion.\r\n\r\n\tShimmer was smiling gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to be afraid, Fluttershy. And I certainly did not mean to startle you. You did well, with that mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy perked up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer nodded once. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did. You remembered your training, and because of you, that mare is likely to live to see another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Head Medic\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice blushed at the praise. \xe2\x80\x9cI, um, I just did what I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, you just acted. And, in light of this, I think it is time we start the next phrase of your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, um\xe2\x80\xa6 advanced training? Or something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you could call it that. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start teaching you the art of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus squeaked at that. \xe2\x80\x9cC-Combat? But I don\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Fluttershy. It is time I taught you how to fight. We Medics cannot always rely on our comrades to protect us while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the battlefield, doing our jobs. The Medic Corps have their own style of fighting, one that has served us well. For we do not fight with weapons, dear Fluttershy. We fight with utensils. Mixtures designed to confuse and incapacitate a foe."\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cO--Oh. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s better than fighting with weapons, and killing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we don\xe2\x80\x99t fight to kill! We save lives, not take them. Report to my office early tomorrow morning, and we shall begin. You are dismissed, Trainee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith only a small nod towards her mentor, Fluttershy retreated towards the front doors. The walk to her foster parent\xe2\x80\x99s house was full of thoughts about what Shimmer had just told her.\r\n', 7, 438032, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'7\'></a><h3>Chapter 7</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>In one of Canterlot Castle\xe2\x80\x99s many private forges, a marshmallow mare was preparing to be hard at work. Her mane lacked its usual coiffer, instead done up in a tight little bun to ensure it would not get in the way. Normally, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Not since she\xe2\x80\x99s mastered everything about metalsmithing Princess Luna and her forgemasters could teach her. But her presence here was special. Try as Luna might, the Monarch couldn&#039;t hope to keep her plans a secret when she came to Rarity, asking the talented mare to work her craft once more. Rarity, of course, had been extremely enthusiastic. Not only would she be able to ply her trade, but she was creating <i>equipment</i> for the new Valkyrie. Armor, to be exact, as well of a couple of other things that could prove useful. Armor that just happened to be the right size for Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s own powerful prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. Rarity, for her part, knew exactly <i>who</i> it was for. There was only one student of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s who held the actual title of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, after all. It also helped that Rarity still recalled Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s exact measurements from a couple of years ago. That mare hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grown all that much since then.</p><p class="indented double">Despite what other ponies might think about Orphans in general, Rarity was not stupid. If Luna was grooming a new Valkyrie, after years and years of not having one, something <i>big</i> was going to happen soon. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what, exactly, and even her slight penchant for gossip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cause enough for her to wonder. But she could think of no other pony more suited to the title and all it entailed than Twilight. The studious mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but she was leader material. Rarity knew this without a doubt. The rest of their band of Orphans knew it. Its what had caused them to come together to face an uncertain world that disliked them simply for having the ear of the Princess. Twilight might not want to admit it, but they were all friends. Maybe not close friends, true, but it was there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through so much, and even now they were still sticking together as much as possible.</p><p class="indented double">Rarity shook those thoughts from her head and once more focused on her movements, prepping her forge for the task ahead. The metal itself had to be extremely thin, almost impossibly so. The only thing the metal part of the armor would be used for was to give shape to the rest of the structure. Naturally, <i>brightsteel</i> was the only reasonable solution; it could be compressed so thin it resembled a piece of paper, yet could still turn aside even the sharpest of weapons. Over the <i>brightsteel</i> was going to be a layer of compressed magic, allowing ease of movement even if the wearer were not used to the heavy weight of the armor. Then, the last layer was going to be amethyst, mined from the Canterlot mines far beneath the castle itself. This amethyst would then have some of the most powerful enhancements any mage could offer placed upon it. In reality, this armor was going to make its wearer a living fortress. It was designed to be light, with full range of movement. The amethyst would then give it a pleasing color and provide some natural protection against magic and weaponry. Then the enchantments and other protections would further offer defensive capabilities. It was, quite easily, the most daunting task Rarity had ever been assigned.</p><p class="indented double">Of course, this really didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern Rarity. She knew what she was doing. Daunting or not, it would be done to perfection. Deciding that she was ready to begin, Rarity picked up the pieces of <i>brightsteel</i> and held them before her, testing their weight with her magic. These were solid nodes, and would serve her well. She placed all three cantaloupe sized pieces into the forge. She would not use all of them, but what she did not use in the crafting of the armor could be used for other things. With a slight flare of magic from her horn, Rarity fed magic into the fire, causing it to burn three times as hot as before. Normally she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare use magic to speed the process, but doing so would cause the <i>brightsteel</i> to become familiar with the touch of magic, preventing the metal from rejecting it later. So long as she was careful, speeding the process wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mar her work. After several moments and when the metal was a cherry red, Rarity used her tongs to remove the <i>brightsteel</i> from the fiery forge. She then laid the metal on her anvils and, with a practiced series of blows, hammered the metal into large plates that were no more than a half an inch thick.</p><p class="indented double">Finished with each plate, the metalsmith then dropped them into a nearby trough of brine. The unicorn paused in her work once more, and then, mentally determining that the metal had cooled sufficiently, pulled all three oblong sheets from the watery substance. Then the mare produced a block of sandstone from her tool station and proceeded to scrape it against the plates to remove the unpleasant black scales that had formed upon the <i>brightsteel</i>. As she scoured the plates, the crystalline structure of the metal was revealed. Rarity set aside one of the plates of metal and examined the other two; it was imperative that the metal she used was of the highest possible quality, and only by examining the crystals could she ensure that her work could proceed. Deciding that the quality of the metal was as perfect as she could hope for, Rarity moved back over to her forge and superheated the <i>brightsteel</i> once more.</p><p class="indented double">This time she left them in the flames until the metal was blindingly white, then removed the metal and slapped both pieces down upon her anvils. Hammers pealed in tandem as they struck the metals, creating a musical symphony. Then, on each plate, Rarity made a cut in the middle, folded each piece back onto each other, and welded those pieces together. As the color of the <i>brightsteel</i> began to fade from white to yellow, Rarity again placed them within the forge. Four more times she repeated this procedure, heating the metal and folding it back upon itself. At the end, she could easily bend the precious metal without it tearing; exactly what she wanted in the first place. Next would come the task of actually fashioning the suit of armor, a feat that made Rarity glad she was a unicorn. Even though her training had taught her how to create metal things without magic, like an earth pony, the fact that she could use her magic made things a whole lot easier in the long run.</p><p class="indented double">Rarity continued her work for a long time.

Her mane lacked its usual coiffer, instead done up in a tight little bun to ensure it would not get in the way. Normally, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Not since she\xe2\x80\x99s mastered everything about metalsmithing Princess Luna and her forgemasters could teach her. But her presence here was special. Try as Luna might, the Monarch couldn\'t hope to keep her plans a secret when she came to Rarity, asking the talented mare to work her craft once more. Rarity, of course, had been extremely enthusiastic. Not only would she be able to ply her trade, but she was creating equipment for the new Valkyrie. Armor, to be exact, as well of a couple of other things that could prove useful. Armor that just happened to be the right size for Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s own powerful prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e. Rarity, for her part, knew exactly who it was for. There was only one student of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s who held the actual title of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, after all. It also helped that Rarity still recalled Twilight Sparkle\xe2\x80\x99s exact measurements from a couple of years ago. That mare hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grown all that much since then.\r\n\r\n\tDespite what other ponies might think about Orphans in general, Rarity was not stupid. If Luna was grooming a new Valkyrie, after years and years of not having one, something big was going to happen soon. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what, exactly, and even her slight penchant for gossip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cause enough for her to wonder. But she could think of no other pony more suited to the title and all it entailed than Twilight. The studious mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but she was leader material. Rarity knew this without a doubt. The rest of their band of Orphans knew it. Its what had caused them to come together to face an uncertain world that disliked them simply for having the ear of the Princess. Twilight might not want to admit it, but they were all friends. Maybe not close friends, true, but it was there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already been through so much, and even now they were still sticking together as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\tRarity shook those thoughts from her head and once more focused on her movements, prepping her forge for the task ahead. The metal itself had to be extremely thin, almost impossibly so. The only thing the metal part of the armor would be used for was to give shape to the rest of the structure. Naturally, brightsteel was the only reasonable solution; it could be compressed so thin it resembled a piece of paper, yet could still turn aside even the sharpest of weapons. Over the brightsteel was going to be a layer of compressed magic, allowing ease of movement even if the wearer were not used to the heavy weight of the armor. Then, the last layer was going to be amethyst, mined from the Canterlot mines far beneath the castle itself. This amethyst would then have some of the most powerful enhancements any mage could offer placed upon it. In reality, this armor was going to make its wearer a living fortress. It was designed to be light, with full range of movement. The amethyst would then give it a pleasing color and provide some natural protection against magic and weaponry. Then the enchantments and other protections would further offer defensive capabilities. It was, quite easily, the most daunting task Rarity had ever been assigned.\r\n\r\n\tOf course, this really didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern Rarity. She knew what she was doing. Daunting or not, it would be done to perfection. Deciding that she was ready to begin, Rarity picked up the pieces of brightsteel and held them before her, testing their weight with her magic. These were solid nodes, and would serve her well. She placed all three cantaloupe sized pieces into the forge. She would not use all of them, but what she did not use in the crafting of the armor could be used for other things. With a slight flare of magic from her horn, Rarity fed magic into the fire, causing it to burn three times as hot as before. Normally she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare use magic to speed the process, but doing so would cause the brightsteel to become familiar with the touch of magic, preventing the metal from rejecting it later. So long as she was careful, speeding the process wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mar her work. After several moments and when the metal was a cherry red, Rarity used her tongs to remove the brightsteel from the fiery forge. She then laid the metal on her anvils and, with a practiced series of blows, hammered the metal into large plates that were no more than a half an inch thick.\r\n\r\n\tFinished with each plate, the metalsmith then dropped them into a nearby trough of brine. The unicorn paused in her work once more, and then, mentally determining that the metal had cooled sufficiently, pulled all three oblong sheets from the watery substance. Then the mare produced a block of sandstone from her tool station and proceeded to scrape it against the plates to remove the unpleasant black scales that had formed upon the brightsteel. As she scoured the plates, the crystalline structure of the metal was revealed. Rarity set aside one of the plates of metal and examined the other two; it was imperative that the metal she used was of the highest possible quality, and only by examining the crystals could she ensure that her work could proceed. Deciding that the quality of the metal was as perfect as she could hope for, Rarity moved back over to her forge and superheated the brightsteel once more.\r\n\r\n\tThis time she left them in the flames until the metal was blindingly white, then removed the metal and slapped both pieces down upon her anvils. Hammers pealed in tandem as they struck the metals, creating a musical symphony. Then, on each plate, Rarity made a cut in the middle, folded each piece back onto each other, and welded those pieces together. As the color of the brightsteel began to fade from white to yellow, Rarity again placed them within the forge. Four more times she repeated this procedure, heating the metal and folding it back upon itself. At the end, she could easily bend the precious metal without it tearing; exactly what she wanted in the first place. Next would come the task of actually fashioning the suit of armor, a feat that made Rarity glad she was a unicorn. Even though her training had taught her how to create metal things without magic, like an earth pony, the fact that she could use her magic made things a whole lot easier in the long run.\r\n\r\n\tRarity continued her work for a long time. Once the single piece suit of armor had been finished, it was time to fuse it together with the amethyst. The air practically hummed with magical energy as the metalsmith continued her task. This part was actually quite easy, as amethyst responds well to magic and is willing to change its shape, so long as somepony knows how to handle it. Rarity eventually began to run on autopilot, her magic completing its tasks without her actively thinking about it. Even though she had only done something like this once before in a lesson, thanks to her penchant for details, once was all she needed to recall every step required. Naturally, with her mind having much more free space, it once more began to wander.\r\n\r\n\tUnlike other students within Canterlot were sure to act when they found out, Rarity couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any sort of animosity towards Twilight Sparkle. Sure, being the Valkyrie meant prestige and recognition. It meant the only other pony higher on the chain of command was Luna. But it also meant having hundreds, if not thousands and millions of underlings looking up to you. Expecting you to know what to do no matter the situation. It meant a whole lot of dedication to the Crown, and aiding Luna with the running of Equestria. Rarity didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any of that. It would take far too much out of her if she even tried. It was much easier to be the realm\xe2\x80\x99s most talented metalsmith, than to have so much responsibility thrust upon her shoulders. She could only hope that Twilight would be up for the task too.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy loved her job. Granted, she was not yet a full blown medic, but she knew she was getting there. And just as surely as she felt herself approaching the completion of her training, her shyness was starting to recede. Part of it, she knew, was from the cloak they had given her-- Head Medic Shimmer, that is. A vast majority of the members of the Medic Corps in the field had one; not only did it distinguish them as a healer, it also provided something else: protection from emotions that could cause a field medic to hesitate. Some emotions, Fluttershy had learned, were good. Compassion, for example, was not something negated by those wondrous cloaks. Compassion for a wounded comrade on the field of battle could speed up a medic\xe2\x80\x99s work, make them eager to take care of the patient. Courage was another emotion that the cloak did not foil, and even sometimes gave to the wearer. Courage could allow a medic rush to the aid of those in need while in the heat of battle.\r\n\r\n\tFor some, the cloak blocked emotions like fear-- fear of failure, of not being fast enough. For others, the cloak blocked hesitation. The slightest bit of pause could cost the patient their life. For Fluttershy, however, the cloak blocked a very important thing: Her shyness. Most of the time, without that cloak of office, Fluttershy was her usual painfully shy self. Once she put that cloak on, she was a different mare entirely. She could feel it. She was assertive. She was in control, and her head was clear enough to make solid decisions while working. And what was even better, she was starting to slowly come out of her shell even with the cloak off. And to her eyes, that right there was the best part of her training. It was surprisingly nice to be able to look ponies in the eye and not flinch away, or immediately hide behind her mane.\r\n\r\n\tAt the moment, Fluttershy was the medic on duty at the front of the main hospital the Medic Corps were stationed at. Why they called it a hospital, Fluttershy was not entirely sure. The towering building was more like an army headquarters that just so happened to have hundreds of rooms to hold patients. Ordinarily, Fluttershy might have questioned why she was the only healer on duty in the reception area; should a patient suddenly be admitted, it would be up to Fluttershy to take care of them, see if they could be healed, and have a room prepared for them if they needed to stay a while. But, Fluttershy knew that Head Medic Shimmer had faith in her. If Shimmer decided that the buttery pegasus was capable of being at this particular post, then Fluttershy would stay here until she was relieved. She was not about to let her mentor down.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s ears quirked, snapping to attention. All was silent. She had thought, for the briefest of moments, she had heard a siren. She strained her ears, trying to catch the elusive sound again. The emergency dispatch teams were the members of the Corps out in the city, at numerous smaller bases. Each member of the EDT carried special magic infused gems, that, when activated, flashed blue and red and emitted a shrill warbling. It warned ponies to clear a path to the closest hospital for the EDTs to take. About the time Fluttershy had decided she had imagined it, the sound came again, and this time stayed. It was faint still, but growing louder by the minute. Fluttershy trotted over to the massive double doors and shoved them open, magical clasps keeping them that way. Then, she waited. There was only one hospital in this area of Canterlot, after all.\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy saw the flashing lights far before the EDT came into view, bouncing off of buildings and lightning up the night sky.The wailing sirens grew to a crescendo of sound, nearly deafening the pegasus. Then the EDT appeared, six earth ponies strong, bearing a stretcher with something on it. The bright lights made it hard for Fluttershy to see what. The six earth ponies skidded to a halt in front of the pegasus, blowing hard, and the sirens mercifully stopped. Without wasting a moment of time, Fluttershy approached the team to see exactly what she was up against. One of the earth ponies, the captain of this unit judging by her short cloak, noticed Fluttershy approaching and spoke, heaving great breaths as she did so.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGiant club fire--down in Night District. Numerous-- were wounded, but this one-- was too severely burned-- for the hospitals down there to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy barely heard the words, staring past the captain with a dawning sense of horror. The pony on the stretcher was so badly burned that at first, Fluttershy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell it was a mare or a stallion. Upon closer inspection, the medic in training determined this was a mare, as her features-- what little of them had not been burned-- were less blocky than a stallion\xe2\x80\x99s. Aside from that, and the horn protruding from the mare\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, there was almost nothing remaining to identify who this mare was. What was left of her main and tail was covered in soot. Her coat and cutie mark was a mystery with all of those burns. The only other thing that could have identified the unicorn was a melted mess of purple colored plastic perched upon her nose, that might have been a pair of fashion glasses at one point in time. The mare, to Fluttershy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, was still breathing, but even she could tell it was weak and harsh.\r\n\r\n\tEven as the medic took all of these details in, her cloak was working to neutralize the horror freezing her in place. In control of her limbs once again, Fluttershy rushed to the burn victim to begin her analysis. Luckily, the unicorn did not seem to be wearing any clothing. This was a good thing, as it would make her treatment much easier later on. The only thing that would pose a problem was the melted plastic stuck to the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle, but that was something that could be taken care of later. From within her ever present satchel Fluttershy withdrew a long, thin tube. She gently prized open the victim\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and fed the tube inside; this would allow medics to use a small ventilator to help the air passageway to remain open. Sticking the other end of the tube into her mouth, Fluttershy blew air into the tube slowly. Judging by the slightly stronger breaths the unicorn was now taking, her airways were clearer.\r\n\r\n\tShe motioned to the exhausted emergency dispatch team and they began to move inside the hospital. Several other medics met them, having heard the sirens and flashing lights. They joined Fluttershy on either side of the patient, checking for severe shock and other complications. Aside from being unconscious, the burned mare didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be suffering from shock, but it never hurt to be sure. The medic in training led her small posse directly to the burn center, where real treatment of the mare could commence. Fluttershy had done all she could by ensuring that the unicorn could still breathe, but the rest was beyond her capabilities. The victim would have to be injected with fluids, to replace those lost and to make sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into shock. Then she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be placed in one of those special burn tanks, while doctors and surgeons set about the task of healing her and regrowing her body. Deciding that the unknown unicorn was in good hooves, Fluttershy decided it would be a good idea to return to her post.\r\n\r\n\tInstead, as she turned around, she came face to face with Shimmer. Fluttershy meeped, startled. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Head Medic. I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Her accursed shyness was returning, despite the cloak\xe2\x80\x99s effort to dispel the emotion.\r\n\r\n\tShimmer was smiling gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to be afraid, Fluttershy. And I certainly did not mean to startle you. You did well, with that mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy perked up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer nodded once. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did. You remembered your training, and because of you, that mare is likely to live to see another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe Head Medic\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice blushed at the praise. \xe2\x80\x9cI, um, I just did what I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, you just acted. And, in light of this, I think it is time we start the next phrase of your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFluttershy tilted her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, um\xe2\x80\xa6 advanced training? Or something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you could call it that. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start teaching you the art of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe pegasus squeaked at that. \xe2\x80\x9cC-Combat? But I don\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Fluttershy. It is time I taught you how to fight. We Medics cannot always rely on our comrades to protect us while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the battlefield, doing our jobs. The Medic Corps have their own style of fighting, one that has served us well. For we do not fight with weapons, dear Fluttershy. We fight with utensils. Mixtures designed to confuse and incapacitate a foe."\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cO--Oh. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s better than fighting with weapons, and killing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tShimmer shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we don\xe2\x80\x99t fight to kill! We save lives, not take them. Report to my office early tomorrow morning, and we shall begin. You are dismissed, Trainee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tWith only a small nod towards her mentor, Fluttershy retreated towards the front doors. The walk to her foster parent\xe2\x80\x99s house was full of thoughts about what Shimmer had just told her.\r\n', 'epub': None}

She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.\r\n\r\n\tFive third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.\r\n\r\n\tIt was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, she was teaching Flitter how to do it. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent's own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she knew they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.\r\n\r\n\tThe third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.\r\n\r\n\tThird year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tComprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won't happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. \r\n\r\n\tThe other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.\r\n\r\n\tOnce she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.\r\n\r\n\tBehind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.\r\n\r\n\tCatching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.\r\n\r\n\tBut no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. \r\n\r\n\tPinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we all know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSoarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n", 'chapter_number': 8, 'parent_chapter_id': 552937, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Chapter 8</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Commander Spitfire leaned against the oak fence surrounding the practice area, keeping an eye on her newest recruits. She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.</p><p class="indented double">Five third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.</p><p class="indented double">It was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, <i>she was teaching Flitter how to do it</i>. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent&#039;s own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she <i>knew</i> they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.</p><p class="indented double">The third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.</p><p class="indented double">Third year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Comprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won&#039;t happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.</p><p class="double"></p><p><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><br /><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. </p><p class="indented double">The other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.</p><p class="indented double">Once she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.</p><p class="indented double">Behind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p class="indented double">Catching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.</p><p class="indented double">But no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. </p><p class="indented double">Pinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Spitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we <i>all</i> know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Soarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 552937, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E3BF50>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Chapter 8</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Commander Spitfire leaned against the oak fence surrounding the practice area, keeping an eye on her newest recruits. She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.</p><p class="indented double">Five third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.</p><p class="indented double">It was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, <i>she was teaching Flitter how to do it</i>. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent&#039;s own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she <i>knew</i> they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.</p><p class="indented double">The third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.</p><p class="indented double">Third year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Comprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won&#039;t happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.</p><p class="double"></p><p><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><br /><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. </p><p class="indented double">The other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.</p><p class="indented double">Once she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.</p><p class="indented double">Behind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p class="indented double">Catching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.</p><p class="indented double">But no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. </p><p class="indented double">Pinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Spitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we <i>all</i> know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Soarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ["//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 8// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tCommander Spitfire leaned against the oak fence surrounding the practice area, keeping an eye on her newest recruits. She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.\r\n\r\n\tFive third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.\r\n\r\n\tIt was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, she was teaching Flitter how to do it. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent's own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she knew they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.\r\n\r\n\tThe third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.\r\n\r\n\tThird year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tComprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won't happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. \r\n\r\n\tThe other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.\r\n\r\n\tOnce she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.\r\n\r\n\tBehind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.\r\n\r\n\tCatching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.\r\n\r\n\tBut no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. \r\n\r\n\tPinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we all know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSoarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n", 8, 552937, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Chapter 8</h3>\n<p class=\'indented\'>Commander Spitfire leaned against the oak fence surrounding the practice area, keeping an eye on her newest recruits. She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.</p><p class="indented double">Five third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.</p><p class="indented double">It was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, <i>she was teaching Flitter how to do it</i>. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">And there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent&#039;s own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. </p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she <i>knew</i> they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.</p><p class="indented double">The third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.</p><p class="indented double">Third year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Comprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won&#039;t happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Both senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.</p><p class="double"></p><p><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><br /><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. </p><p class="indented double">The other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.</p><p class="indented double">The Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.</p><p class="indented double">Once she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.</p><p class="indented double">Behind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p class="indented double">Catching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.</p><p class="indented double">But no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. </p><p class="indented double">Pinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.</p><p class="double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Spitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.</p><p class="indented double">Fleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Spitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we <i>all</i> know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Soarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': "//------------------------------//\n// Chapter 8// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\tCommander Spitfire leaned against the oak fence surrounding the practice area, keeping an eye on her newest recruits. She pawed the turf with a forehoof thoughtfully. There were a grand total of twenty six new Cadets this year. All of them were completely green behind the ears, but in time, they\xe2\x80\x99d all make fine Wonderbolts. Well, except for one. The familiar chromatic mane stood out glaringly from the rest of the Cadets, practically screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m different!\xe2\x80\x9d. Spitfire had meant what she had told her Princess. Before long, Rainbow Dash could easily take over Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s position, if the Commander ever decided to retire. However, that abrupt turn of thoughts made her smile wryly. Her, retire? The thought was preposterous. Commander Spitfire has been commanding officer of the entire Wonderbolt military division for the past thousand years at least, and it would probably be several thousand more before she would be spent. That thought, naturally, led to yet another. Such a long timespan, to be in service to Equestria and her beloved Princess. Once upon a time, it had been more than one Princess she had served\xe2\x80\xa6 And as soon as she had that thought, Spitfire mentally slapped herself and buried the painful memories yet again. She really needed to get her mind to stop wandering like that.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire forced herself to return back to idly watching her Cadets. They had each split off into pairs, sparring with each other. Each was dressed in a light chainmail tunic, heavy padded helm, and had wooden taloned caps on their hooves. Eventually, the recruits would progress to drilling with actual hoof caps-- albeit with blunted edges and points, and then later would choose the weapon they planned to master. But that was still some months away, by which time the less suitable recruits would have been weeded out. It was quite normal for at least a third of Wonderbolt applicants to drop out of the harsh training in the first three months. Sometimes it was the pegasus\xe2\x80\x99 choice. For others, it was at the discretion of his or her instructors or, in extreme cases, Spitfire herself. The Wonderbolts were harsh and standards were strict. They had to be. The practice yard rang with the thudding of wood against wood. At the head of the yard, Captain Soarin called the standard strokes that were being practiced. As he called out the sequence, one Cadet would administer the attacks while the other blocked them. Then, when Soarin started the same sequence over, the second Cadet would deliver while the first blocked.\r\n\r\n\tFive third-year cadets, under the direction of Lieutenant Fleetfoot, moved among the pegasi, attending to the detail of the basic hoof strikes: correcting a wrong movement here, changing the angle of a stroke there, making sure another recruit\xe2\x80\x99s caps weren\xe2\x80\x99t dropping too far as he or she struck. It was rather repetitive work under the glaring hot sun, but it was necessary. These drills might be what decides if a Wonderbolt lives or dies at some later point. These basic moves needed to be instinctual, plain and simple.\r\n\r\n\tIt was actually with this thought in mind that Spitfire once more found her eyes returning to Rainbow Dash and her sparring partner, a promising young filly named Flitter. She had been watching Dash for some time now, observing the strikes the chromatic Cadet was delivering. As Soarin called out the basic strikes, Rainbow Dash was adding an extra stroke or two to her strikes, and somehow managed to not fall behind in her timing. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interesting enough, she was teaching Flitter how to do it. Dash would add in an unexpected and uncalled strike, Flitter would counter, and then, within the next sequence, Flitter would perform the same move. Dash would counter, and then begin anew. Soarin began another sequence and Spitfire narrowed her eyes, watching the duo attentively.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tAnd there it was. As Soarin called the backhoof overhead, Dash would deliver it, then immediately switch to a side slash, allowing the block from the backhoof overhead to redirect her weapon into the second blow. Flitter would then perform a swift block and immediately come in with a return side slash as Soarin began the sequence again, starting her return attacks. The move had been so lightning fast, it would have been devastating if Flitter had not blocked it. The opponent's own guard would have been raised high to stop the backhoof overhead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to get his guard down fast enough to stop the attack from the side. Spitfire continued to watch as Flitter delivered the sequence, then, like Dash, added the blazing side slash. Dash blocked, and prepared to start anew. Spitfire had first became aware of this situation from the corner of her eye, noting a slight variation in the normal flurry of activity. And even then, the extra strike came so fast it still took her a while to hone in on where it was coming from.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin called. Spitfire then noticed that while most of the other recruits lowered their weapons and returned to standing on all fours, Rainbow Dash and Flitter maintained their ready position, forehooves up in the classic ready stance. But apparently, somepony else had finally noticed the variation in the drill. Fleetfoot called over one of the third year cadets and had a whispered conversation, gesturing at the pair. Dash and Flitter, still focused on each other, didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exchange. They both looked up, startled, as the third year approached them.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou two! At training circle three. What do you two think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Both Cadets looked a little anxious now, even more so when they realized that every eye in the area was focused on them. Including their superiors.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d Both inquired at almost the same time. It was clear they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they were being singled out.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNeither one of you are following the correct pattern. Follow Captain Soarin\xe2\x80\x99s call, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire, now watching carefully, was convinced that the pair\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was very real. The first years shared a slight look, before Dash asked again.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am? What\xe2\x80\x99re you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe third year was starting to get annoyed now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the extra strokes, but now assumed that the first years were simply following an attack sequence entirely of their own devising. She frowned at the pair dangerously, speaking in a voice that was far too loud for the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Soarin calls the drills. You perform them as he calls them. No more funny business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash looked slightly angry now, glaring at the third year, and Flitter frowned herself before speaking. \r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\xa6 We did.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter gulped nervously. She knew she was never supposed to argue with a senior pegasus, but she knew they had completed the strokes as Soarin called them.\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire saw the third year hesitate. She still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the pair had supposedly done, but had only followed Fleetfoot\xe2\x80\x99s comments. The third year now tried to cover her hesitation with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you did, did you? Then what sequence did he call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash replied tersely. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Side Slash. Overhead cut. Thrust\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c...backhoof slash. Backhoof overhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter finished for her partner, proving that she had been paying attention too.\r\n\r\n\tThe third year looked completely flummoxed now. She had expected the two to hesitate, or try to bluff their way through the matter. But to the best of her memory, the pair had called out the strikes perfectly, and in the correct order. The third year glanced around desperately, looking for somepony to help her. Fleetfoot finally made her way over.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, Blossom?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot had originally called this to Blossom\xe2\x80\x99s attention and told her to reprimand the pair for deviating from the pattern. That reprimand should have already been delivered, and practice resumed. But now however, the entire class had their attention, and it was being disrupted.\r\n\r\n\tThird year Blossom came to a salute. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, both trainees claim they completed the sequence as it was called. They both repeated it in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tRainbow Dash opened her mouth to rebuke the scathing tone Blossom used, but suddenly decided against such an action. The last thing she needed was demerits.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHold a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfood and Blossom glanced around, a little flabbergasted. They had not seen Spitfire approaching. All around, the rest of the Cadets all came to stiff attentiveness. Both Dash and Flitter paled a little at seeing their commanding officer approach. They looked as though they could already see their immediate dismissal from the Wonderbolt Academy looming upon the horizon.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall the sequence, Cadet Rainbow Dash, Cadet Flitter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth pegasi nodded eagerly. Then, remembering that this was not a suitable response in the presence of their senior, they spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Sequence seven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire noted that they both called the sequence correctly for the second time. She also doubted that any of the other Cadets could have even come close to calling it right. \xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps you could repeat it for us again,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, her voice hiding her burning curiosity.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTake your positions\xe2\x80\xa6 begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tThe two pegasi performed the sequence flawlessly, calling the strokes as they went. \xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d The wooden caps clashed with each other magnificently. The timing was perfect. The forms of the two first years were completely flawless. Spitfire hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even seen experienced second years able to pull off a sequence so perfectly. But, this time around, there was no extra stroke. After a bit of careful consideration, Spitfire thought she knew why: The first years were focused on getting the sequence correct. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing everything by instinct. Soarin, attracted to the presence of his commander on the field itself, slowly approached, asking with his eyes. Spitfire barely shook her head, warning him to step lightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the Cadets to have their concentration interrupted.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSequence two! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOverhead cut! Thrust! Backstep! Cap parry! Side slash! Underhand side slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin and Fleetfoot were starting to look impressed. The two Cadets were practically chanting the sequence. The partners were moving lightly on their hooves now, hoof caps flickering out and about, following the cadence nearly half as quickly again as Soarin had originally been calling them. Spitfire once more shook her head imperceptibly. She wanted to show them what she was sure was going to happen next. Before Dash and Flitter even had time to think, Spitfire called again. \xe2\x80\x9cSequence seven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash! Overhead cut! Thrust! Backhoof slash! Backhoof overhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSide slash!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire snapped and, completely instinctively, Dash executed that dangerous extra move that Flitter neatly blocked with her own blazing speed, then proceeded to do the same thing against Dash. There were very slight noises of surprise from Soarin and Fleetfoot. They understood the significance of what they had seen, and seemed even more impressed on how quickly Flitter had responded to that extra attack.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire ordered, and once more, her two Cadets immediately returned to their ready stances, forehooves up and weaving slightly on their hind hooves.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rainbow Dash, Flitter.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that side slash you executed the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tComprehension dawned in their eyes at roughly the same moment. \xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6 I think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Flitter replied.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSorry ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It won't happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Dash echoed.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no harm done. Just next time, pay better attention to what is being called.\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire turned away and was a few steps towards the fencing when she casually turned back towards Soarin and Fleetfoot.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I want to see you two in my office later. We have some issues to discuss regarding the state of the armory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tBoth senior Wonderbolts nodded. They understood that Spitfire wanted to discuss what had happened here, but did not want Dash or Flitter to be aware.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cCarry on, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Commander Spitfire turned away, she heard Soarin call out the preparation orders, and then the solid sound of wood striking wood resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPinkie Pie frowned thoughtfully. This by itself was surprising; Pinkie never frowned. Ever. Since the death of her parents, Pinkie became a firm believer in smiling to make the pain go away. And being able to bring smiles to other ponies was just icing on the cake. Or maybe cupcake? Pinkie loved cupcakes more than cake, sure. Cupcakes were travel ready. The pink mare shook her head swiftly, as though to chase away those errant thoughts. Now was the time to focus, not go off on some tangent that had nothing to do with her current mission. The thought of the mission Zecora had tasked her with deepened her frown, if that was even possible. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her superior she was annoyed with, oh no. Zecora was a really nice Zebra and an excellent teacher. But what Pinkie was upset about the most was the nature of this mission. Her parents had died in a fire, and being told to investigate the still smoldering ruins of that giant fire from last night made her uneasy, and was thus partially the source of her frown. \r\n\r\n\tThe other part of her frown was simply a by product of wanting to find the culprit who had started the fire. Early intel strongly hinted at the fire being set on purpose, rather than just happening in an accident. So Pinkie was also frowning at the thought of somepony being meany pants enough to deliberately start a fire. Which was why the pink mare was out here in the first place, prowling around the outskirts of what used to be a building. Zecora firmly believed that the only way to learn the trade of an information gatherer was to actually be out in the field at all times. As Zecora had cleverly put it, you cannot hand an agent a book and expect them to learn from said book. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any real way to learn what needed to be learned unless you were out in the real world, learning from your mistakes and teaching yourself new tricks.\r\n\r\n\tThe Royal Guards still patrolling the wreckage paid her no mind, even going so far as to stare seemingly straight through her. This caused Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s frown to slowly melt, to be replaced by a slight smile. She touched the gem at her throat, the little thrum of magic telling her it was still active. True invisibility was something only the most adept unicorns could accomplish, so agents of Equestrian Intelligence settled for the next best thing: Being unnoticeable. Rather than attempting to cause light to bend around the pony body like most unicorns do, an Unnoticeable Charm rendered a caster well\xe2\x80\xa6 unnoticeable. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the full mechanics of it, to be honest. All she really understood was that the charm would prevent others from perceiving the fact that she was standing in plain sight. There were drawbacks to being unnoticeable, of course. If she ran into somepony the spell would fail to hide her. If she moved too quickly or made a loud noise, she could be discovered. But slinking past a pair of Royal Guards? Cake. Or cupcake. Whatever.\r\n\r\n\tOnce she actually entered the burned building proper, she moved a little easier, knowing that the ash that coated everything would mask her hoofsteps. The sharp tang of burned wood greeted her everywhere she turned, and she wrinkled her nose. Her baby blue eyes glanced around carefully as she tried to decide where to start. She had entered the building from the right side, where the natural shade cast by the store next door made it even easier to make it past the guards. Judging by the stone foundations, this had been a small storage room of sorts. It was far too small to be a part of the main floor, or any of the other private rooms. After some careful prodding, she found a bent piece of metal, like what you would find in the head of an industrial broom. It seemed her assumption was correct, but this room really didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her much of anything. Stepping lightly, Pinkie moved into what had probably been a long hall once. There were intervals in the foundation, as if doors had once stood there.\r\n\r\n\tBehind Pinkie was the outside, so she moved forward, passing non-existent doors as she went. She cast her eyes carefully from left to right, but these assumed rooms didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to offer much in the way of clues. Pinkie finally moved far enough inside she made it to what had definitely been the main room. Remnants of a dance floor dotted the ground here and there. In the very center of the room rested what was left of the stage. Trotting over for a better look, Pinkie noted the thick, relatively unscarred chains attached to all four corners. So this had been one of those popular suspended stages then. Hanging from the center of the room, such stages provided increased sound. This one looked as though it had been cracked in two when it struck the ground below, long before the flames had managed to ravish it. Easing gently around part of the stage that was canted upward, Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s hunch was confirmed as she saw the remains of a small staircase that would have lead up to the stage floor. As the mare went to move farther into the place, she stumbled and nearly fell.\r\n\r\n\tCatching her balance swiftly, Pinkie glanced back at what she had tripped on. Eyes narrowing slightly, a forehoof gently brushed away ash. She had uncovered a fire suppression system. Or what was left of one, anyway. The metal was twisted almost completely beyond recognition, but what caught Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s attention was the fact that the sprinkler head was still sealed with the protective seal. There was only one reason why the head would still be sealed: The fire had appeared so suddenly, and burned so hotly, that the metal piping had collapsed before the sprinkler could go off. And judging by the destruction around her, the water inside the suppression system had been nowhere near enough to put out the fire. Pinkie mentally filed away this information to be put on her report for later, and continued on.\r\n\r\n\tBut no matter how much she probed into the ruined club, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything other than the failed suppression system. The only thing she really knew was that the fire had apparently appeared out of thin air, and burned hot enough to melt metals and evaporate water before it could be doused. None of this made any sense at all. A part of her wanted to just mark this off as an extremely dangerous accidental fire, but something was stopping her. There had to be something she was missing. As the pink mare turned to start heading back towards the front of the building, though, a slight flash of orange caught her eye. She whirled back around, staring intently. In one of the rear-most corners of the building, there was something orange gleaming there. It seemed to pulse, as though it were some monstrous heart. The only reason she had seen it was because the area it was resting in was overshadowed by the restaurant next door.\r\n\r\n\tPinkie approached the thing cautiously, almost expecting an attack. But nothing happened. Whatever it was just sat there, like it had been casually tossed aside. The infiltrator in training stopped a short distance away, her head titled quizzically. It looked like nothing she had ever seen before. She stood like that for a long time, observing it. Little strands or darker red-orange snaked across the object\xe2\x80\x99s surface, almost like veins. It was the size of a small watermelon. And all the time she stared at it, it never stopped pulsing. Finally, Pinkie inched forward slowly. As she did so, she began to notice the heat. It grew slightly in intensity as she approached closer, though it never got unbearable. Finally, tentatively, Pinkie reached out a hoof and brushed the strange thing. It was warm, quite warm, but not hot enough to burn. It almost felt as though it was cooling off after whatever it had been used for. \r\n\r\n\tPinkie lifted the round object up carefully, but the even closer inspection did not reveal any secrets to her. Hesitating for but a moment, the mare pulled open one of the saddlebags she had strapped to her sides. The thing just barely fit inside, filling the dark space with bright orange light. She waited for a moment, ensuring that whatever this was would not burn through her bag. Then, satisfied that the evidence was secure, she carefully made her way back towards her infiltration point. Pinkie didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this odd object had caused the fire here or not, but Zecora would want to see it. The zebra might even actually know what it was.\r\n\r\n<<((*))>>\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire had barely taken a seat behind her slightly cluttered desk before the Soarin and Fleetfoot entered. While they settled themselves, Spitfire reached off to one side and grabbed a jug of ale sitting there. She took a quick swig of the drink to clear her thoughts before she turned to regard her two officers. The commander folded her forehooves before her as she awaited the inevitable question. It was Soarin who spoke first.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you saw it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Spitfire moved to set the jug of ale on the surface before her, making a simple gesture. Soarin nodded in thanks and took a quick swig before passing it off to Fleetfoot, eyes slowly wandering around the room. Soarin had only been in Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99s office once or twice, and each time it really amazed him at how spartan it was. Other high ranking officers used their important status to decorate rather lavishly, but that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Spitfire did things. She was efficient and practical, and the surroundings drove home the point.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleetfoot said. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I did at first, but I saw it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou both only saw it once. They were doing it the entire time. At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pinpoint why the rhythm seemed off. I was watching the overall drill, and not looking at specific areas. It took me a few minutes to hone in on where it was coming from, and then I watched them repeat those moves for several minutes before you became aware of it yourself, Soarin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only instance?\xe2\x80\x9d the male pegasus sounded as if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion he wanted to feel.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that drill set, either. Each drill you called out, no matter which one it was, they were adding an extra little move that could potentially have devastating effects if put into actual use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot frowned slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I kind of expect something like this from Dash. But Flitter? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good recruit, but I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see her instinctively doing something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because Dash was teaching it to Flitter subconsciously. If I were to hazard a guess, Dash is going to make a very good leader someday in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that even possible? Teaching a move to somepony else without actually pausing to explain what was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire shrugged slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is what I saw. Unless Dash has been coaching Flitter outside of drill practice, it was all instinctual-- like Dash was the leader and Flitter was the follower. Dash is commander material. Plain and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cLike you?\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin asked, an eyebrow arched subtly.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like me.\xe2\x80\x9d came the steady reply. Spitfire held the gazes of her officers, unflinching.\r\n\r\n\tFleetfoot seemed to be hesitating with her next words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think its because of her ties to\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6. you-know-what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSpitfire paused to actually consider the question, before the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that makes the most sense. But to Inspire others so easily\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9c... She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more powerful than you were at the height of your power.\xe2\x80\x9d Soarin finished for his commanding officer.\r\n\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. The signs are there. The best we can actually do right now is coach her as best we can. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her realize that there is something unique about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to come into this slowly, or she risks becoming corrupt. And we all know what happened last time, even if you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t here for it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you both have duties to attend to. Return to them, and remember: Keep quiet about this to everypony. You\xe2\x80\x99re both not supposed to know half of what you do, but I trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\tSoarin and Fleetfoot both saluted, touching their right hooves to their left aligned Wonderbolt pins. Then the two lesser officers turned smartly and left Spitfire alone with her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n", 'epub': None}

It swirled and eddied gently in the small practice chamber, creating a perpetual gloom that would probably be fitting at a haunted house. In the center of it all stood a lavender unicorn, eyes clenched in concentration and horn awash with power. A rather adorable scowl accompanied her features as she maintained her casting. At her left side floated a glaive on a bed of magic, a green glyph glowing bright on the weapon. To the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s right stood an undead that could have been a twin of the practicing unicorn, if it weren't for the majestic wings resting folded upon her form. The undead\xe2\x80\x99s luminous gaze never wavered from her partner, as if willing the spell to take form. Slightly behind Starshard stood the powerful form of Princess Luna, staring at her student with an almost feverishly proud gaze. There was nothing said, no sounds uttered save the steady hum of magic at work.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly, ever so slowly, a form began to appear. First a head, followed by a slender neck and shoulders. The figure grew sharply and then actually climbed up out of the ground, shaking its forehooves as it did so. The form then began to shake its entire body, as though shrugging off the last vestiges of death. The creature was definitely a mare, as seen by her slender form and roundish face. Her entire body seemed to be made of a dull white bone, little fragments knitted together to complete it. Her mane and tail resembled liquid mercury, hanging flat and limp around her form. Her eyes glowed a luminous yellow, though there were no iris or pupil, or even any hint of an eyeball at all. Then, as the magic completed itself, proud pair of wings sprouted from the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back, made from the same materials as her mane and tail.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a small echoing pop of discharging magic, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn ceased its bright glow. She released a pent up breath of exertion and finally opened her eyes. They immediately sought out the fruits of her labors, widening slightly as they did so. The creature before her cocked her head in an obviously intelligent and self aware gesture, but did not speak. The apprentice approached slowly, trotting a gentle circle around the object of her fascination. As far as she could tell, Twilight Sparkle had completed her spellcasting perfectly. Rather than second guess herself, the mare turned to her necromancy tutor expectantly.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard allowed a brief grin to flash upon her bold muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, student. You\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully summoned your first elemental.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDid I do it correctly? Did I miss anything?\xe2\x80\x9d The unicorn tried to keep the rising excitement from her tone, with mixed results.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard moved forward a few paces, studying the elemental. \xe2\x80\x9cOverall, your form was good, and strong. You took the incantation and immediately started casting with it, while others would have been rather stumped. You did take a little too long to summon her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected on your first try. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become faster and more comfortable the more you practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight glanced up. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what\xe2\x80\x99s she made out of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn astute question. Elementals differ from caster to caster. No two are exactly the same, even elementals summoned from differing planes of magic by the same caster. In this case, your elemental consists of the ivory often found deep beneath the earth-- remnants of an age long past. Ivory is often used by necromancers to enhance their spells in certain ways, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a necromancy elemental made from the stuff. Undoubtedly she could make a powerful ally in the future.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHer mane and tail aren\xe2\x80\x99t really there at all, and are merely a projection of the elemental\xe2\x80\x99s will. This is the only part of the summoning process that the elemental can influence themselves; it's how they give themselves a personality. Seeing as hers has the appearance of liquid mercury, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably rather cool and level-headed most of the time-- just like her creator.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, Twilight felt herself blushing slightly. She definitely was not used to praise.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCan she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d The student asked quickly, willing her reddened cheeks to stop glowing.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo. While they are fully self aware and are every bit as alive as you or I, it is not possible for an elemental to replicate vocal cords. Nor can they hear. To instruct an elemental upon a task, the necromancer instead uses his or her will, just like a spell. Go on, give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Feeling slightly foolish for a brief moment, Twilight bent her will into the elemental, as if she were casting magic. To her slight amazement, the elemental immediately broke into a canter around the room before coming back to a rest in front of its master, butting the lavender unicorn upon her shoulder. Twilight glanced up to see Soulshard smiling slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will she last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends on the caster. An elemental will stay summoned for an indefinite amount of time, unless severely wounded or otherwise incapacitated. Then they must return to the ether to recharge. To dismiss her, simply will her to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight did as she was instructed, then watched as the necromancy elemental disappeared back into what appeared to be a hole in the ground, this time much more quickly than she had left it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is possible to summon different elementals from different magical branches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard nodded briefly, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Most casters can only maintain one at a time, but some exceptionally gifted can summon two. Very rarely can a caster summon three, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall a normal caster being able to summon four or more. Even having two active requires a very disciplined mind, as the caster has to continuously watch over both creatures. During future lessons, you will be expected to summon forth an elemental to aid you in your tasks. For now, however, we are done for the day. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress in your studies so far, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a bit of relaxation. Unless your mentor has any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I do not. Go on, my apprentice. Enjoy the rest of the night, and sleep well. I shall call you on next evening, when it is time to resume your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bowing once to her princess and nodding slightly to Soulshard, Twilight Sparkle found herself back in one of Canterlot\xe2\x80\x99s expansive halls. Despite the fact that she had been released from her duties as a student, the young unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind was still abuzz with everything she\xe2\x80\x99d learned in the past couple of days. Necromancy, as she was quickly starting to understand, was so much more than just summoning the dead to do your bidding. If anything, Necromancers were more of a\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cdark warlock\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. In addition to being able to commune and ask the undead for aid, Necromancers could do a whole host of other things-- some that were even helpful. For example, her earliest lessons centered around creating curses to aid as well as harm. Most of them were rather simplistic-- minor blindness, aches and pains, spells designed to make their target quite uncomfortable. But other curses could heal small injuries, mend broken hearing, and even slow down the effects of poison. Twilight meandered on, not even really paying attention to where she was going. She barely realized that she had exited the palace, so wrapped up in her thoughts. \r\n\r\n\tToday, of course, detailed her first step into summoning an elemental. They were an extension of the caster\xe2\x80\x99s will. Exceedingly durable and easily re-summoned, an elemental was designed to be called upon when in need-- during the heat of battle, for instance. And naturally, the stronger the summoner\xe2\x80\x99s mind the stronger the elemental became. Some mages even used them as a page of sorts, sending elementals out to complete mundane tasks that their masters had no time for. Or, in the case of nobility, tasks they thought beneath them. Elementals could even be used to gauge a spellcaster\xe2\x80\x99s power. If the elemental looked healthier than most, or if a mage had more than one elemental active at a time, it was a sign of quite a bit of power and a willful mind. Twilight found herself wondering if she would be able to summon an elemental from each plane of magic and have them performing tasks at the same time. The thought was completely ludicrous, but it still caused a warm smile to blossom upon her muzzle.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight found herself pausing in front of a gate. A very familiar gate, emblazoned with the mark of her house: a bright burgundy six pointed star, superimposed over another white six pointed star and five smaller white stars surrounding it. With slightly shaky magic, the unicorn nudged open the gate and stepped, for the first time in years, into the grounds of the Twinkle manor. Even after all this time, the place was immaculate, signalling that some dedicated servant or other had been here. The rolling grass hills were neatly trimmed. The main cobblestone walkway had been swept. Trees and glowing lamps still stood sentinel at the sides of each walkway, forming a sort of maze. And off in the distance, Twilight saw and heard a little splash from the pond as a fish jumped. The mare trotted up to the closed front door, her hooves clopping gently on stone. Closing her eyes briefly, Twilight inserted her magical signature into the proud double doors. There was a brief pause, before the sound of magical and physical locks unlocking rent the air. With barely a whisper, the giant doors swung open of their own accord, settling with a muted boom.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight stepped gingerly into the giant entryway. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have very many memories of this place. But deep down in her very being, she could feel it. This was her home. No matter how comfortable her quarters in Canterlot was, the Twinkle manor was still her home. The unicorn mare threaded her way deeper into the building, lamps already alight and guiding her way. There was the main dining room to the right of the main hallway, with the kitchen just behind it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine servants bustling to and fro, serving her family in happier times. Then there was the living room, complete with one of those new televisions and a couple of couches. Then came the bar, the game room, and the Star room-- complete with multiple telescopes. The second floor consisted of multiple bedrooms. Most were completely empty; even the master bedroom that had to have belonged to her parents. However, the last bedroom she wandered into had to have been her own. The walls matched the color of her coat, and against one wall resided a double sized bed with her House emblem on the blanket. Another wall held an assortment of books and stuff animals, and the north wall held a pretty little vanity mirror.\r\n\r\n\tWiping tears from her eyes, Twilight closed the door to her old room and proceeded up the stairs to the final floor of her old home. This floor, in its entirety, was a library. Shelves upon shelves of books stood guard over neat little isles. In the center of the room rested several bean bags and reading tables, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speck of dust to be seen. Since there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any cleaning spells active, somepony had been in here to clean-- and recently, too. The unicorn prowled the area, slightly in awe at the sheer number of books. This library probably rivaled the Canterlot Archives, and Twilight would bet that there were books here that not even Canterlot held. With a final, longing glance around, Twilight descended towards the first floor. There would surely be time for reading later.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Twilight came down the stairs, she noticed an open door off to the side with another staircase leading into what seemed to be a basement. Curious, she trotted down. Her eyes widened at what she saw. This\xe2\x80\xa6 This must have been the private armory of her parents. Weapons were everywhere she looked-- hanging from walls and displayed proudly from showcases. There were simply too many to take notice of at a casual glance. Mechanical training dummies dotted the room here and there, waiting for an operator to activate them. Off in one corner was a roped off fighting ring, very similar to the one she saw in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s armory. As Twilight stepped further into the room, she also began to see entire suits of armor in addition to the weapons-- anything from full plate to half plate, leather and silk. If Twilight had to guess, there was a small fortune down here alone-- and far more instruments of war than she\xe2\x80\x99d seen anywhere else. Her parents had been Equestrian Intelligence agents, but this stuff looked as though it could supply a small army and then some.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight ascended back to the main entryway of her manor, glancing around as she did so. Yes, she could get used to living here again. But\xe2\x80\xa6 not alone. It was entirely too quiet here. While the bookish unicorn did love solitude on numerous occasions, a home this big was not meant to house just one pony. Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps she could ask her other orphans if they would like to move in? Yes, that would work, if they accepted. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why not, after all. It would beat living here without another living soul in sight. Decided upon a course of action and determined to carry it out, Twilight exited the manor with a spring in her step. As she locked the door and turned to leave, a thought also occurred to her. I should really find the ponies responsible for keeping this place maintained and thank them.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna stared at the object before her in horrified fascination. Her mouth struggled to find words, before she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s where this\xe2\x80\xa6 thing came from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Majesty, that is exactly where it came from, and it is exactly what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s voice was solemn, and she was serious enough to use a formal title. \xe2\x80\x9cPinkamena Diane Pie found this and it so did thrum. Its discovery leads us ever closer to the brink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna shook her head wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s already capable of sending her agents against us, we\xe2\x80\x99re drawing short on time indeed. We may not have enough time to prepare at this rate. You said the unicorn mare caught in the blaze was one of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tZecora nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cVinyl Scratch is her real name, but DJ Pon3 when playing the music game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see her. Maybe I can speed her recovery myself. If Flare\xe2\x80\x99s already mustered enough power to send a Suntouched, this Vinyl Scratch may have some valuable information regarding the changing world. Does Pinkamena know what this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The zebra shook her head, earrings jingling.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Try to ensure that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find out. At least not yet. None of them are ready to have this thrust upon them. If we move too quickly, things will be over before it's even begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 'chapter_number': 9, 'parent_chapter_id': 693233, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'9\'></a><h3>Chapter 9</h3>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A hazy fog of green magic permeated the room. It swirled and eddied gently in the small practice chamber, creating a perpetual gloom that would probably be fitting at a haunted house. In the center of it all stood a lavender unicorn, eyes clenched in concentration and horn awash with power. A rather adorable scowl accompanied her features as she maintained her casting. At her left side floated a glaive on a bed of magic, a green glyph glowing bright on the weapon. To the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s right stood an undead that could have been a twin of the practicing unicorn, if it weren&#039;t for the majestic wings resting folded upon her form. The undead\xe2\x80\x99s luminous gaze never wavered from her partner, as if willing the spell to take form. Slightly behind Starshard stood the powerful form of Princess Luna, staring at her student with an almost feverishly proud gaze. There was nothing said, no sounds uttered save the steady hum of magic at work.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly, ever so slowly, a form began to appear. First a head, followed by a slender neck and shoulders. The figure grew sharply and then actually climbed up out of the ground, shaking its forehooves as it did so. The form then began to shake its entire body, as though shrugging off the last vestiges of death. The creature was definitely a mare, as seen by her slender form and roundish face. Her entire body seemed to be made of a dull white bone, little fragments knitted together to complete it. Her mane and tail resembled liquid mercury, hanging flat and limp around her form. Her eyes glowed a luminous yellow, though there were no iris or pupil, or even any hint of an eyeball at all. Then, as the magic completed itself, proud pair of wings sprouted from the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back, made from the same materials as her mane and tail.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a small echoing pop of discharging magic, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn ceased its bright glow. She released a pent up breath of exertion and finally opened her eyes. They immediately sought out the fruits of her labors, widening slightly as they did so. The creature before her cocked her head in an obviously intelligent and self aware gesture, but did not speak. The apprentice approached slowly, trotting a gentle circle around the object of her fascination. As far as she could tell, Twilight Sparkle had completed her spellcasting perfectly. Rather than second guess herself, the mare turned to her necromancy tutor expectantly.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard allowed a brief grin to flash upon her bold muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, student. You\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully summoned your first elemental.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDid I do it correctly? Did I miss anything?\xe2\x80\x9d The unicorn tried to keep the rising excitement from her tone, with mixed results.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard moved forward a few paces, studying the elemental. \xe2\x80\x9cOverall, your form was good, and strong. You took the incantation and immediately started casting with it, while others would have been rather stumped. You did take a little too long to summon her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected on your first try. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become faster and more comfortable the more you practice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight glanced up. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what\xe2\x80\x99s she made out of?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn astute question. Elementals differ from caster to caster. No two are exactly the same, even elementals summoned from differing planes of magic by the same caster. In this case, your elemental consists of the ivory often found deep beneath the earth-- remnants of an age long past. Ivory is often used by necromancers to enhance their spells in certain ways, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a necromancy elemental made from the stuff. Undoubtedly she could make a powerful ally in the future.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHer mane and tail aren\xe2\x80\x99t really there at all, and are merely a projection of the elemental\xe2\x80\x99s will. This is the only part of the summoning process that the elemental can influence themselves; it&#039;s how they give themselves a personality. Seeing as hers has the appearance of liquid mercury, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably rather cool and level-headed most of the time-- just like her creator.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, Twilight felt herself blushing slightly. She <i>definitely</i> was not used to praise.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCan she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d The student asked quickly, willing her reddened cheeks to stop glowing.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo. While they are fully self aware and are every bit as alive as you or I, it is not possible for an elemental to replicate vocal cords. Nor can they hear. To instruct an elemental upon a task, the necromancer instead uses his or her will, just like a spell. Go on, give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Feeling slightly foolish for a brief moment, Twilight bent her will into the elemental, as if she were casting magic. To her slight amazement, the elemental immediately broke into a canter around the room before coming back to a rest in front of its master, butting the lavender unicorn upon her shoulder. Twilight glanced up to see Soulshard smiling slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will she last?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends on the caster. An elemental will stay summoned for an indefinite amount of time, unless severely wounded or otherwise incapacitated. Then they must return to the ether to recharge. To dismiss her, simply will her to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight did as she was instructed, then watched as the necromancy elemental disappeared back into what appeared to be a hole in the ground, this time much more quickly than she had left it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is possible to summon different elementals from different magical branches?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard nodded briefly, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Most casters can only maintain one at a time, but some exceptionally gifted can summon two. Very rarely can a caster summon three, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall a normal caster being able to summon four or more. Even having two active requires a <i>very</i> disciplined mind, as the caster has to continuously watch over both creatures. During future lessons, you will be expected to summon forth an elemental to aid you in your tasks. For now, however, we are done for the day. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress in your studies so far, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a bit of relaxation. Unless your mentor has any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I do not. Go on, my apprentice. Enjoy the rest of the night, and sleep well. I shall call you on next evening, when it is time to resume your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bowing once to her princess and nodding slightly to Soulshard, Twilight Sparkle found herself back in one of Canterlot\xe2\x80\x99s expansive halls.

It swirled and eddied gently in the small practice chamber, creating a perpetual gloom that would probably be fitting at a haunted house. In the center of it all stood a lavender unicorn, eyes clenched in concentration and horn awash with power. A rather adorable scowl accompanied her features as she maintained her casting. At her left side floated a glaive on a bed of magic, a green glyph glowing bright on the weapon. To the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s right stood an undead that could have been a twin of the practicing unicorn, if it weren&#039;t for the majestic wings resting folded upon her form. The undead\xe2\x80\x99s luminous gaze never wavered from her partner, as if willing the spell to take form. Slightly behind Starshard stood the powerful form of Princess Luna, staring at her student with an almost feverishly proud gaze. There was nothing said, no sounds uttered save the steady hum of magic at work.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly, ever so slowly, a form began to appear. First a head, followed by a slender neck and shoulders. The figure grew sharply and then actually climbed up out of the ground, shaking its forehooves as it did so. The form then began to shake its entire body, as though shrugging off the last vestiges of death. The creature was definitely a mare, as seen by her slender form and roundish face. Her entire body seemed to be made of a dull white bone, little fragments knitted together to complete it. Her mane and tail resembled liquid mercury, hanging flat and limp around her form. Her eyes glowed a luminous yellow, though there were no iris or pupil, or even any hint of an eyeball at all. Then, as the magic completed itself, proud pair of wings sprouted from the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back, made from the same materials as her mane and tail.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a small echoing pop of discharging magic, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn ceased its bright glow. She released a pent up breath of exertion and finally opened her eyes. They immediately sought out the fruits of her labors, widening slightly as they did so. The creature before her cocked her head in an obviously intelligent and self aware gesture, but did not speak. The apprentice approached slowly, trotting a gentle circle around the object of her fascination. As far as she could tell, Twilight Sparkle had completed her spellcasting perfectly. Rather than second guess herself, the mare turned to her necromancy tutor expectantly.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard allowed a brief grin to flash upon her bold muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, student.

You took the incantation and immediately started casting with it, while others would have been rather stumped. You did take a little too long to summon her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected on your first try. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become faster and more comfortable the more you practice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight glanced up. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what\xe2\x80\x99s she made out of?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn astute question. Elementals differ from caster to caster. No two are exactly the same, even elementals summoned from differing planes of magic by the same caster. In this case, your elemental consists of the ivory often found deep beneath the earth-- remnants of an age long past. Ivory is often used by necromancers to enhance their spells in certain ways, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a necromancy elemental made from the stuff. Undoubtedly she could make a powerful ally in the future.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHer mane and tail aren\xe2\x80\x99t really there at all, and are merely a projection of the elemental\xe2\x80\x99s will. This is the only part of the summoning process that the elemental can influence themselves; it&#039;s how they give themselves a personality. Seeing as hers has the appearance of liquid mercury, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably rather cool and level-headed most of the time-- just like her creator.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, Twilight felt herself blushing slightly. She <i>definitely</i> was not used to praise.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCan she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d The student asked quickly, willing her reddened cheeks to stop glowing.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo. While they are fully self aware and are every bit as alive as you or I, it is not possible for an elemental to replicate vocal cords. Nor can they hear. To instruct an elemental upon a task, the necromancer instead uses his or her will, just like a spell. Go on, give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Feeling slightly foolish for a brief moment, Twilight bent her will into the elemental, as if she were casting magic. To her slight amazement, the elemental immediately broke into a canter around the room before coming back to a rest in front of its master, butting the lavender unicorn upon her shoulder. Twilight glanced up to see Soulshard smiling slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will she last?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends on the caster. An elemental will stay summoned for an indefinite amount of time, unless severely wounded or otherwise incapacitated. Then they must return to the ether to recharge. To dismiss her, simply will her to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight did as she was instructed, then watched as the necromancy elemental disappeared back into what appeared to be a hole in the ground, this time much more quickly than she had left it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is possible to summon different elementals from different magical branches?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard nodded briefly, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Most casters can only maintain one at a time, but some exceptionally gifted can summon two. Very rarely can a caster summon three, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall a normal caster being able to summon four or more. Even having two active requires a <i>very</i> disciplined mind, as the caster has to continuously watch over both creatures. During future lessons, you will be expected to summon forth an elemental to aid you in your tasks. For now, however, we are done for the day. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress in your studies so far, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a bit of relaxation. Unless your mentor has any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I do not. Go on, my apprentice. Enjoy the rest of the night, and sleep well. I shall call you on next evening, when it is time to resume your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bowing once to her princess and nodding slightly to Soulshard, Twilight Sparkle found herself back in one of Canterlot\xe2\x80\x99s expansive halls. Despite the fact that she had been released from her duties as a student, the young unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind was still abuzz with everything she\xe2\x80\x99d learned in the past couple of days. Necromancy, as she was quickly starting to understand, was so much more than just summoning the dead to do your bidding. If anything, Necromancers were more of a\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cdark warlock\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. In addition to being able to commune and ask the undead for aid, Necromancers could do a whole host of other things-- some that were even helpful. For example, her earliest lessons centered around creating curses to aid as well as harm. Most of them were rather simplistic-- minor blindness, aches and pains, spells designed to make their target quite uncomfortable. But other curses could heal small injuries, mend broken hearing, and even slow down the effects of poison. Twilight meandered on, not even really paying attention to where she was going. She barely realized that she had exited the palace, so wrapped up in her thoughts. </p><p class="indented double">Today, of course, detailed her first step into summoning an elemental. They were an extension of the caster\xe2\x80\x99s will. Exceedingly durable and easily re-summoned, an elemental was designed to be called upon when in need-- during the heat of battle, for instance. And naturally, the stronger the summoner\xe2\x80\x99s mind the stronger the elemental became. Some mages even used them as a page of sorts, sending elementals out to complete mundane tasks that their masters had no time for. Or, in the case of nobility, tasks they thought beneath them. Elementals could even be used to gauge a spellcaster\xe2\x80\x99s power. If the elemental looked healthier than most, or if a mage had more than one elemental active at a time, it was a sign of quite a bit of power and a willful mind. Twilight found herself wondering if she would be able to summon an elemental from each plane of magic and have them performing tasks at the same time. The thought was completely ludicrous, but it still caused a warm smile to blossom upon her muzzle.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight found herself pausing in front of a gate. A very familiar gate, emblazoned with the mark of her house: a bright burgundy six pointed star, superimposed over another white six pointed star and five smaller white stars surrounding it. With slightly shaky magic, the unicorn nudged open the gate and stepped, for the first time in years, into the grounds of the Twinkle manor. Even after all this time, the place was immaculate, signalling that some dedicated servant or other had been here. The rolling grass hills were neatly trimmed. The main cobblestone walkway had been swept. Trees and glowing lamps still stood sentinel at the sides of each walkway, forming a sort of maze. And off in the distance, Twilight saw and heard a little splash from the pond as a fish jumped. The mare trotted up to the closed front door, her hooves clopping gently on stone. Closing her eyes briefly, Twilight inserted her magical signature into the proud double doors. There was a brief pause, before the sound of magical and physical locks unlocking rent the air. With barely a whisper, the giant doors swung open of their own accord, settling with a muted boom.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight stepped gingerly into the giant entryway. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have very many memories of this place. But deep down in her very being, she could feel it. This was her <i>home</i>. No matter how comfortable her quarters in Canterlot was, the Twinkle manor was still her home. The unicorn mare threaded her way deeper into the building, lamps already alight and guiding her way. There was the main dining room to the right of the main hallway, with the kitchen just behind it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine servants bustling to and fro, serving her family in happier times. Then there was the living room, complete with one of those new televisions and a couple of couches. Then came the bar, the game room, and the Star room-- complete with multiple telescopes. The second floor consisted of multiple bedrooms. Most were completely empty; even the master bedroom that had to have belonged to her parents. However, the last bedroom she wandered into had to have been her own. The walls matched the color of her coat, and against one wall resided a double sized bed with her House emblem on the blanket. Another wall held an assortment of books and stuff animals, and the north wall held a pretty little vanity mirror.</p><p class="indented double">Wiping tears from her eyes, Twilight closed the door to her old room and proceeded up the stairs to the final floor of her old home. This floor, in its entirety, was a library. Shelves upon shelves of books stood guard over neat little isles. In the center of the room rested several bean bags and reading tables, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speck of dust to be seen. Since there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any cleaning spells active, somepony had been in here to clean-- and recently, too. The unicorn prowled the area, slightly in awe at the sheer number of books. This library probably rivaled the Canterlot Archives, and Twilight would bet that there were books here that not even Canterlot held. With a final, longing glance around, Twilight descended towards the first floor. There would surely be time for reading later.</p><p class="indented double">As Twilight came down the stairs, she noticed an open door off to the side with another staircase leading into what seemed to be a basement. Curious, she trotted down. Her eyes widened at what she saw. This\xe2\x80\xa6 This must have been the private armory of her parents. Weapons were everywhere she looked-- hanging from walls and displayed proudly from showcases. There were simply too many to take notice of at a casual glance. Mechanical training dummies dotted the room here and there, waiting for an operator to activate them. Off in one corner was a roped off fighting ring, very similar to the one she saw in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s armory. As Twilight stepped further into the room, she also began to see entire suits of armor in addition to the weapons-- anything from full plate to half plate, leather and silk. If Twilight had to guess, there was a small fortune down here alone-- and far more instruments of war than she\xe2\x80\x99d seen anywhere else. Her parents had been Equestrian Intelligence agents, but this stuff looked as though it could supply a small army and then some.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight ascended back to the main entryway of her manor, glancing around as she did so. Yes, she could get used to living here again. But\xe2\x80\xa6 not alone. It was entirely too quiet here. While the bookish unicorn did love solitude on numerous occasions, a home this big was not meant to house just one pony. Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps she could ask her other orphans if they would like to move in? Yes, that would work, if they accepted. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why not, after all. It would beat living here without another living soul in sight. Decided upon a course of action and determined to carry it out, Twilight exited the manor with a spring in her step. As she locked the door and turned to leave, a thought also occurred to her. <i>I should really find the ponies responsible for keeping this place maintained and thank them.</i></p><p class="indented double"><center>&lt;&lt;((*))&gt;&gt;</center></p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna stared at the object before her in horrified fascination. Her mouth struggled to find words, before she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s where this\xe2\x80\xa6 <i>thing</i> came from?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Majesty, that is exactly where it came from, and it is exactly what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s voice was solemn, and she was serious enough to use a formal title. \xe2\x80\x9cPinkamena Diane Pie found this and it so did thrum. Its discovery leads us ever closer to the brink.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna shook her head wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s already capable of sending her agents against us, we\xe2\x80\x99re drawing short on time indeed.

To dismiss her, simply will her to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight did as she was instructed, then watched as the necromancy elemental disappeared back into what appeared to be a hole in the ground, this time much more quickly than she had left it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is possible to summon different elementals from different magical branches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard nodded briefly, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Most casters can only maintain one at a time, but some exceptionally gifted can summon two. Very rarely can a caster summon three, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall a normal caster being able to summon four or more. Even having two active requires a very disciplined mind, as the caster has to continuously watch over both creatures. During future lessons, you will be expected to summon forth an elemental to aid you in your tasks. For now, however, we are done for the day. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress in your studies so far, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a bit of relaxation. Unless your mentor has any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I do not. Go on, my apprentice. Enjoy the rest of the night, and sleep well. I shall call you on next evening, when it is time to resume your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bowing once to her princess and nodding slightly to Soulshard, Twilight Sparkle found herself back in one of Canterlot\xe2\x80\x99s expansive halls. Despite the fact that she had been released from her duties as a student, the young unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind was still abuzz with everything she\xe2\x80\x99d learned in the past couple of days. Necromancy, as she was quickly starting to understand, was so much more than just summoning the dead to do your bidding. If anything, Necromancers were more of a\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cdark warlock\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. In addition to being able to commune and ask the undead for aid, Necromancers could do a whole host of other things-- some that were even helpful. For example, her earliest lessons centered around creating curses to aid as well as harm. Most of them were rather simplistic-- minor blindness, aches and pains, spells designed to make their target quite uncomfortable. But other curses could heal small injuries, mend broken hearing, and even slow down the effects of poison. Twilight meandered on, not even really paying attention to where she was going. She barely realized that she had exited the palace, so wrapped up in her thoughts. \r\n\r\n\tToday, of course, detailed her first step into summoning an elemental. They were an extension of the caster\xe2\x80\x99s will. Exceedingly durable and easily re-summoned, an elemental was designed to be called upon when in need-- during the heat of battle, for instance. And naturally, the stronger the summoner\xe2\x80\x99s mind the stronger the elemental became. Some mages even used them as a page of sorts, sending elementals out to complete mundane tasks that their masters had no time for. Or, in the case of nobility, tasks they thought beneath them. Elementals could even be used to gauge a spellcaster\xe2\x80\x99s power. If the elemental looked healthier than most, or if a mage had more than one elemental active at a time, it was a sign of quite a bit of power and a willful mind. Twilight found herself wondering if she would be able to summon an elemental from each plane of magic and have them performing tasks at the same time. The thought was completely ludicrous, but it still caused a warm smile to blossom upon her muzzle.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight found herself pausing in front of a gate. A very familiar gate, emblazoned with the mark of her house: a bright burgundy six pointed star, superimposed over another white six pointed star and five smaller white stars surrounding it. With slightly shaky magic, the unicorn nudged open the gate and stepped, for the first time in years, into the grounds of the Twinkle manor. Even after all this time, the place was immaculate, signalling that some dedicated servant or other had been here. The rolling grass hills were neatly trimmed. The main cobblestone walkway had been swept. Trees and glowing lamps still stood sentinel at the sides of each walkway, forming a sort of maze. And off in the distance, Twilight saw and heard a little splash from the pond as a fish jumped. The mare trotted up to the closed front door, her hooves clopping gently on stone. Closing her eyes briefly, Twilight inserted her magical signature into the proud double doors. There was a brief pause, before the sound of magical and physical locks unlocking rent the air. With barely a whisper, the giant doors swung open of their own accord, settling with a muted boom.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight stepped gingerly into the giant entryway. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have very many memories of this place. But deep down in her very being, she could feel it. This was her home. No matter how comfortable her quarters in Canterlot was, the Twinkle manor was still her home. The unicorn mare threaded her way deeper into the building, lamps already alight and guiding her way. There was the main dining room to the right of the main hallway, with the kitchen just behind it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine servants bustling to and fro, serving her family in happier times. Then there was the living room, complete with one of those new televisions and a couple of couches. Then came the bar, the game room, and the Star room-- complete with multiple telescopes. The second floor consisted of multiple bedrooms. Most were completely empty; even the master bedroom that had to have belonged to her parents. However, the last bedroom she wandered into had to have been her own. The walls matched the color of her coat, and against one wall resided a double sized bed with her House emblem on the blanket. Another wall held an assortment of books and stuff animals, and the north wall held a pretty little vanity mirror.\r\n\r\n\tWiping tears from her eyes, Twilight closed the door to her old room and proceeded up the stairs to the final floor of her old home. This floor, in its entirety, was a library. Shelves upon shelves of books stood guard over neat little isles. In the center of the room rested several bean bags and reading tables, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speck of dust to be seen. Since there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any cleaning spells active, somepony had been in here to clean-- and recently, too. The unicorn prowled the area, slightly in awe at the sheer number of books. This library probably rivaled the Canterlot Archives, and Twilight would bet that there were books here that not even Canterlot held. With a final, longing glance around, Twilight descended towards the first floor. There would surely be time for reading later.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Twilight came down the stairs, she noticed an open door off to the side with another staircase leading into what seemed to be a basement. Curious, she trotted down. Her eyes widened at what she saw. This\xe2\x80\xa6 This must have been the private armory of her parents. Weapons were everywhere she looked-- hanging from walls and displayed proudly from showcases. There were simply too many to take notice of at a casual glance. Mechanical training dummies dotted the room here and there, waiting for an operator to activate them. Off in one corner was a roped off fighting ring, very similar to the one she saw in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s armory. As Twilight stepped further into the room, she also began to see entire suits of armor in addition to the weapons-- anything from full plate to half plate, leather and silk. If Twilight had to guess, there was a small fortune down here alone-- and far more instruments of war than she\xe2\x80\x99d seen anywhere else. Her parents had been Equestrian Intelligence agents, but this stuff looked as though it could supply a small army and then some.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight ascended back to the main entryway of her manor, glancing around as she did so. Yes, she could get used to living here again. But\xe2\x80\xa6 not alone. It was entirely too quiet here. While the bookish unicorn did love solitude on numerous occasions, a home this big was not meant to house just one pony. Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps she could ask her other orphans if they would like to move in? Yes, that would work, if they accepted. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why not, after all. It would beat living here without another living soul in sight. Decided upon a course of action and determined to carry it out, Twilight exited the manor with a spring in her step. As she locked the door and turned to leave, a thought also occurred to her. I should really find the ponies responsible for keeping this place maintained and thank them.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna stared at the object before her in horrified fascination. Her mouth struggled to find words, before she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s where this\xe2\x80\xa6 thing came from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Majesty, that is exactly where it came from, and it is exactly what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s voice was solemn, and she was serious enough to use a formal title. \xe2\x80\x9cPinkamena Diane Pie found this and it so did thrum. Its discovery leads us ever closer to the brink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna shook her head wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s already capable of sending her agents against us, we\xe2\x80\x99re drawing short on time indeed. We may not have enough time to prepare at this rate. You said the unicorn mare caught in the blaze was one of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tZecora nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cVinyl Scratch is her real name, but DJ Pon3 when playing the music game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see her. Maybe I can speed her recovery myself. If Flare\xe2\x80\x99s already mustered enough power to send a Suntouched, this Vinyl Scratch may have some valuable information regarding the changing world. Does Pinkamena know what this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The zebra shook her head, earrings jingling.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Try to ensure that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find out. At least not yet. None of them are ready to have this thrust upon them. If we move too quickly, things will be over before it's even begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n", 9, 693233, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'9\'></a><h3>Chapter 9</h3>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A hazy fog of green magic permeated the room. It swirled and eddied gently in the small practice chamber, creating a perpetual gloom that would probably be fitting at a haunted house. In the center of it all stood a lavender unicorn, eyes clenched in concentration and horn awash with power. A rather adorable scowl accompanied her features as she maintained her casting. At her left side floated a glaive on a bed of magic, a green glyph glowing bright on the weapon. To the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s right stood an undead that could have been a twin of the practicing unicorn, if it weren&#039;t for the majestic wings resting folded upon her form. The undead\xe2\x80\x99s luminous gaze never wavered from her partner, as if willing the spell to take form. Slightly behind Starshard stood the powerful form of Princess Luna, staring at her student with an almost feverishly proud gaze. There was nothing said, no sounds uttered save the steady hum of magic at work.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly, ever so slowly, a form began to appear. First a head, followed by a slender neck and shoulders. The figure grew sharply and then actually climbed up out of the ground, shaking its forehooves as it did so. The form then began to shake its entire body, as though shrugging off the last vestiges of death. The creature was definitely a mare, as seen by her slender form and roundish face. Her entire body seemed to be made of a dull white bone, little fragments knitted together to complete it. Her mane and tail resembled liquid mercury, hanging flat and limp around her form. Her eyes glowed a luminous yellow, though there were no iris or pupil, or even any hint of an eyeball at all. Then, as the magic completed itself, proud pair of wings sprouted from the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back, made from the same materials as her mane and tail.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a small echoing pop of discharging magic, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn ceased its bright glow. She released a pent up breath of exertion and finally opened her eyes. They immediately sought out the fruits of her labors, widening slightly as they did so. The creature before her cocked her head in an obviously intelligent and self aware gesture, but did not speak. The apprentice approached slowly, trotting a gentle circle around the object of her fascination. As far as she could tell, Twilight Sparkle had completed her spellcasting perfectly. Rather than second guess herself, the mare turned to her necromancy tutor expectantly.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard allowed a brief grin to flash upon her bold muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, student. You\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully summoned your first elemental.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDid I do it correctly? Did I miss anything?\xe2\x80\x9d The unicorn tried to keep the rising excitement from her tone, with mixed results.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard moved forward a few paces, studying the elemental. \xe2\x80\x9cOverall, your form was good, and strong. You took the incantation and immediately started casting with it, while others would have been rather stumped. You did take a little too long to summon her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected on your first try. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become faster and more comfortable the more you practice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight glanced up. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what\xe2\x80\x99s she made out of?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn astute question. Elementals differ from caster to caster. No two are exactly the same, even elementals summoned from differing planes of magic by the same caster. In this case, your elemental consists of the ivory often found deep beneath the earth-- remnants of an age long past. Ivory is often used by necromancers to enhance their spells in certain ways, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a necromancy elemental made from the stuff. Undoubtedly she could make a powerful ally in the future.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHer mane and tail aren\xe2\x80\x99t really there at all, and are merely a projection of the elemental\xe2\x80\x99s will. This is the only part of the summoning process that the elemental can influence themselves; it&#039;s how they give themselves a personality. Seeing as hers has the appearance of liquid mercury, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably rather cool and level-headed most of the time-- just like her creator.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, Twilight felt herself blushing slightly. She <i>definitely</i> was not used to praise.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCan she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d The student asked quickly, willing her reddened cheeks to stop glowing.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo. While they are fully self aware and are every bit as alive as you or I, it is not possible for an elemental to replicate vocal cords. Nor can they hear. To instruct an elemental upon a task, the necromancer instead uses his or her will, just like a spell. Go on, give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Feeling slightly foolish for a brief moment, Twilight bent her will into the elemental, as if she were casting magic. To her slight amazement, the elemental immediately broke into a canter around the room before coming back to a rest in front of its master, butting the lavender unicorn upon her shoulder. Twilight glanced up to see Soulshard smiling slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will she last?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends on the caster.

It swirled and eddied gently in the small practice chamber, creating a perpetual gloom that would probably be fitting at a haunted house. In the center of it all stood a lavender unicorn, eyes clenched in concentration and horn awash with power. A rather adorable scowl accompanied her features as she maintained her casting. At her left side floated a glaive on a bed of magic, a green glyph glowing bright on the weapon. To the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s right stood an undead that could have been a twin of the practicing unicorn, if it weren't for the majestic wings resting folded upon her form. The undead\xe2\x80\x99s luminous gaze never wavered from her partner, as if willing the spell to take form. Slightly behind Starshard stood the powerful form of Princess Luna, staring at her student with an almost feverishly proud gaze. There was nothing said, no sounds uttered save the steady hum of magic at work.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly, ever so slowly, a form began to appear. First a head, followed by a slender neck and shoulders. The figure grew sharply and then actually climbed up out of the ground, shaking its forehooves as it did so. The form then began to shake its entire body, as though shrugging off the last vestiges of death. The creature was definitely a mare, as seen by her slender form and roundish face. Her entire body seemed to be made of a dull white bone, little fragments knitted together to complete it. Her mane and tail resembled liquid mercury, hanging flat and limp around her form. Her eyes glowed a luminous yellow, though there were no iris or pupil, or even any hint of an eyeball at all. Then, as the magic completed itself, proud pair of wings sprouted from the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back, made from the same materials as her mane and tail.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With a small echoing pop of discharging magic, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn ceased its bright glow. She released a pent up breath of exertion and finally opened her eyes. They immediately sought out the fruits of her labors, widening slightly as they did so. The creature before her cocked her head in an obviously intelligent and self aware gesture, but did not speak. The apprentice approached slowly, trotting a gentle circle around the object of her fascination. As far as she could tell, Twilight Sparkle had completed her spellcasting perfectly. Rather than second guess herself, the mare turned to her necromancy tutor expectantly.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard allowed a brief grin to flash upon her bold muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, student. You\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully summoned your first elemental.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDid I do it correctly? Did I miss anything?\xe2\x80\x9d The unicorn tried to keep the rising excitement from her tone, with mixed results.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard moved forward a few paces, studying the elemental. \xe2\x80\x9cOverall, your form was good, and strong. You took the incantation and immediately started casting with it, while others would have been rather stumped. You did take a little too long to summon her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected on your first try. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become faster and more comfortable the more you practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight glanced up. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what\xe2\x80\x99s she made out of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn astute question. Elementals differ from caster to caster. No two are exactly the same, even elementals summoned from differing planes of magic by the same caster. In this case, your elemental consists of the ivory often found deep beneath the earth-- remnants of an age long past. Ivory is often used by necromancers to enhance their spells in certain ways, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a necromancy elemental made from the stuff. Undoubtedly she could make a powerful ally in the future.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHer mane and tail aren\xe2\x80\x99t really there at all, and are merely a projection of the elemental\xe2\x80\x99s will. This is the only part of the summoning process that the elemental can influence themselves; it's how they give themselves a personality. Seeing as hers has the appearance of liquid mercury, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably rather cool and level-headed most of the time-- just like her creator.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words, Twilight felt herself blushing slightly. She definitely was not used to praise.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCan she speak?\xe2\x80\x9d The student asked quickly, willing her reddened cheeks to stop glowing.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo. While they are fully self aware and are every bit as alive as you or I, it is not possible for an elemental to replicate vocal cords. Nor can they hear. To instruct an elemental upon a task, the necromancer instead uses his or her will, just like a spell. Go on, give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Feeling slightly foolish for a brief moment, Twilight bent her will into the elemental, as if she were casting magic. To her slight amazement, the elemental immediately broke into a canter around the room before coming back to a rest in front of its master, butting the lavender unicorn upon her shoulder. Twilight glanced up to see Soulshard smiling slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will she last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it depends on the caster. An elemental will stay summoned for an indefinite amount of time, unless severely wounded or otherwise incapacitated. Then they must return to the ether to recharge. To dismiss her, simply will her to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twilight did as she was instructed, then watched as the necromancy elemental disappeared back into what appeared to be a hole in the ground, this time much more quickly than she had left it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is possible to summon different elementals from different magical branches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soulshard nodded briefly, pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Most casters can only maintain one at a time, but some exceptionally gifted can summon two. Very rarely can a caster summon three, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall a normal caster being able to summon four or more. Even having two active requires a very disciplined mind, as the caster has to continuously watch over both creatures. During future lessons, you will be expected to summon forth an elemental to aid you in your tasks. For now, however, we are done for the day. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress in your studies so far, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a bit of relaxation. Unless your mentor has any objection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, I do not. Go on, my apprentice. Enjoy the rest of the night, and sleep well. I shall call you on next evening, when it is time to resume your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bowing once to her princess and nodding slightly to Soulshard, Twilight Sparkle found herself back in one of Canterlot\xe2\x80\x99s expansive halls. Despite the fact that she had been released from her duties as a student, the young unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s mind was still abuzz with everything she\xe2\x80\x99d learned in the past couple of days. Necromancy, as she was quickly starting to understand, was so much more than just summoning the dead to do your bidding. If anything, Necromancers were more of a\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cdark warlock\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. In addition to being able to commune and ask the undead for aid, Necromancers could do a whole host of other things-- some that were even helpful. For example, her earliest lessons centered around creating curses to aid as well as harm. Most of them were rather simplistic-- minor blindness, aches and pains, spells designed to make their target quite uncomfortable. But other curses could heal small injuries, mend broken hearing, and even slow down the effects of poison. Twilight meandered on, not even really paying attention to where she was going. She barely realized that she had exited the palace, so wrapped up in her thoughts. \r\n\r\n\tToday, of course, detailed her first step into summoning an elemental. They were an extension of the caster\xe2\x80\x99s will. Exceedingly durable and easily re-summoned, an elemental was designed to be called upon when in need-- during the heat of battle, for instance. And naturally, the stronger the summoner\xe2\x80\x99s mind the stronger the elemental became. Some mages even used them as a page of sorts, sending elementals out to complete mundane tasks that their masters had no time for. Or, in the case of nobility, tasks they thought beneath them. Elementals could even be used to gauge a spellcaster\xe2\x80\x99s power. If the elemental looked healthier than most, or if a mage had more than one elemental active at a time, it was a sign of quite a bit of power and a willful mind. Twilight found herself wondering if she would be able to summon an elemental from each plane of magic and have them performing tasks at the same time. The thought was completely ludicrous, but it still caused a warm smile to blossom upon her muzzle.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight found herself pausing in front of a gate. A very familiar gate, emblazoned with the mark of her house: a bright burgundy six pointed star, superimposed over another white six pointed star and five smaller white stars surrounding it. With slightly shaky magic, the unicorn nudged open the gate and stepped, for the first time in years, into the grounds of the Twinkle manor. Even after all this time, the place was immaculate, signalling that some dedicated servant or other had been here. The rolling grass hills were neatly trimmed. The main cobblestone walkway had been swept. Trees and glowing lamps still stood sentinel at the sides of each walkway, forming a sort of maze. And off in the distance, Twilight saw and heard a little splash from the pond as a fish jumped. The mare trotted up to the closed front door, her hooves clopping gently on stone. Closing her eyes briefly, Twilight inserted her magical signature into the proud double doors. There was a brief pause, before the sound of magical and physical locks unlocking rent the air. With barely a whisper, the giant doors swung open of their own accord, settling with a muted boom.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight stepped gingerly into the giant entryway. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have very many memories of this place. But deep down in her very being, she could feel it. This was her home. No matter how comfortable her quarters in Canterlot was, the Twinkle manor was still her home. The unicorn mare threaded her way deeper into the building, lamps already alight and guiding her way. There was the main dining room to the right of the main hallway, with the kitchen just behind it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine servants bustling to and fro, serving her family in happier times. Then there was the living room, complete with one of those new televisions and a couple of couches. Then came the bar, the game room, and the Star room-- complete with multiple telescopes. The second floor consisted of multiple bedrooms. Most were completely empty; even the master bedroom that had to have belonged to her parents. However, the last bedroom she wandered into had to have been her own. The walls matched the color of her coat, and against one wall resided a double sized bed with her House emblem on the blanket. Another wall held an assortment of books and stuff animals, and the north wall held a pretty little vanity mirror.\r\n\r\n\tWiping tears from her eyes, Twilight closed the door to her old room and proceeded up the stairs to the final floor of her old home. This floor, in its entirety, was a library. Shelves upon shelves of books stood guard over neat little isles. In the center of the room rested several bean bags and reading tables, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a speck of dust to be seen. Since there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any cleaning spells active, somepony had been in here to clean-- and recently, too. The unicorn prowled the area, slightly in awe at the sheer number of books. This library probably rivaled the Canterlot Archives, and Twilight would bet that there were books here that not even Canterlot held. With a final, longing glance around, Twilight descended towards the first floor. There would surely be time for reading later.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Twilight came down the stairs, she noticed an open door off to the side with another staircase leading into what seemed to be a basement. Curious, she trotted down. Her eyes widened at what she saw. This\xe2\x80\xa6 This must have been the private armory of her parents. Weapons were everywhere she looked-- hanging from walls and displayed proudly from showcases. There were simply too many to take notice of at a casual glance. Mechanical training dummies dotted the room here and there, waiting for an operator to activate them. Off in one corner was a roped off fighting ring, very similar to the one she saw in Princess Luna\xe2\x80\x99s armory. As Twilight stepped further into the room, she also began to see entire suits of armor in addition to the weapons-- anything from full plate to half plate, leather and silk. If Twilight had to guess, there was a small fortune down here alone-- and far more instruments of war than she\xe2\x80\x99d seen anywhere else. Her parents had been Equestrian Intelligence agents, but this stuff looked as though it could supply a small army and then some.\r\n\t\r\n\tTwilight ascended back to the main entryway of her manor, glancing around as she did so. Yes, she could get used to living here again. But\xe2\x80\xa6 not alone. It was entirely too quiet here. While the bookish unicorn did love solitude on numerous occasions, a home this big was not meant to house just one pony. Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps she could ask her other orphans if they would like to move in? Yes, that would work, if they accepted. Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why not, after all. It would beat living here without another living soul in sight. Decided upon a course of action and determined to carry it out, Twilight exited the manor with a spring in her step. As she locked the door and turned to leave, a thought also occurred to her. I should really find the ponies responsible for keeping this place maintained and thank them.\r\n\t\r\n\t<<((*))>>\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna stared at the object before her in horrified fascination. Her mouth struggled to find words, before she finally spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s where this\xe2\x80\xa6 thing came from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Majesty, that is exactly where it came from, and it is exactly what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d Zecora\xe2\x80\x99s voice was solemn, and she was serious enough to use a formal title. \xe2\x80\x9cPinkamena Diane Pie found this and it so did thrum.

Princess Luna of Equestria tore her tear streaked gaze from the window and tried to compose herself.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice, still laced with grief hours later, was barely above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ornate doors, depicting the four cutie marks of the Princesses of Equestria, opened slowly. A lone pony stepped through, one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Home Guard. The soldier carried something in his orange magic, objects that Luna recognized immediately. The once proud staff may have been splintered, the Nightsteel may have been tarnished from the rigors of war, but the glaive of the Valkyrie was still identifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found this, Princess. Its the only other part of her we\xe2\x80\x99ve found, save her armor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chest constricted painfully, and it was all she could do to prevent herself from falling into helpless sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. She\xe2\x80\x99s truly gone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard removed his helmet and bowed his head, echoing the sorrow of his liege. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your highness. We did everything we could to find her and bring her back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna wiped her silently shed tears away almost angrily, then glanced up at the guard again. It was obvious that the Home Guard had seen some heavy, heavy fighting. Several cuts and bruises crisscrossed this one\xe2\x80\x99s face. His armor was dented and covered in a layer of grime. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should get out of here while you can. Get all of the remaining Home Guard out of Canterlot. Get away from this cursed place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already shaking his head, lips set into a determined frown. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, princess. The Home Guard will stand with our charge, just like we have always done in ages past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an order from your princess: Withdraw.

We will guard the throne room. We will hold as long as we can. When those bastards break through, I hope the Home Guard will have weakened them enough for you to mop up their ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doors closed behind the guard with booming finality. Luna stared after him for several moments, before she realized he had set the remains of the weapon right next to the portal. Tears threatened to overcome her barriers yet again. When things went to Tartarus, she was the one there to keep her steady. She was the one to keep things mostly under control, battlehardened far beyond the other three Alicorns, including her sister. And now, she was gone. Her wife. Her other half. Her heart. Gone. There was a slight movement from behind Princess Luna, and she turned slowly.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There, standing proud as ever, were her four closest friends in the world. They were all making preparations, more than ready to stand with the last Princess of the Equestrian Crown. Captain Spitfire. Loyalty. Leader of the Wonderbolts fighting force and one of the most powerful pegasi to date. The physical embodiment of Loyalty hung about her neck, glinting blood red and shaped like her cutie mark. Zecora. Laughter. For being an unparalleled spymaster, the zebra had an astounding sense of humor and always took the opportunity to make others laugh. Sky blue graced her neck. Then came Shimmer. Kindness. The mare did everything in her power to aid those less fortunate, and still wore her medical coat with pride. Pink glimmered brightly. And finally, Halt. A pony so dependable and honest he would crawl through Tartarus and back for a friend. Orange gleamed cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna completed the fifth Element of Harmony. She was Generosity incarnate. How could she not be, with how she treated her subjects? Always spending resources from her own House to improve the lives of the average citizen, and never asking for a single thing in return. Dark purple shined against her black coat, right below her torc. The only Element missing was Magic. And this Element was the reason Luna\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom was on the verge of collapsing around her. With great power comes great responsibility, and her poor sister Celestia simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the power.\r\n\r\n\t"I thought I made it clear that you four should not be here." Luna\'s stern voice was slightly ruined with tears still glimmering in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\t"And I thought I had made it clear that we weren\'t going to be leaving our friend." Spitfire retorted. "Never mind the fact that she\'s a princess."\r\n\r\n\t"What\'s with all of my military personnel ignoring my orders?" The dark Alicorn demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\n\t"Because you\'re making bad calls." Shimmer snapped. This gave Luna pause. The medical pony never talked like that. However, she rallied quickly.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bad call to want to keep those I care about safe? Is it so wrong for me to wish for no more deaths at my hooves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t"Shimmer has a point." Halt added in his usual slow way. "Even if we could get out of Canterlot, what then? We\'d be killed long before we could reach the border. And if by some miracle we\'re not, do you expect one of the other nations to harbor known \'terrorists\'? Nay. I say we test our mettle right here, standing in defiance against the evil that plagues us."\r\n\r\n\tZecora didn\'t say anything, but then again she didn\'t have to. She was as ready for a fight as the rest of them. Luna stood there, mulling over their words. In hindsight, ordering them to abandon her and their home was a bit redundant. The sounds of fighting in the long hallway leading to the room suddenly reached her ears. She heard her Home Guard crying out in a single voice, shouting their fury to the world. Weapons clashed, magic cackled, and bodies slumped to the floor. The fighting was so very close now. Almost right on top of the closed doors. The captain of the Home Guard tried to rally his remaining ponies. His exclamation turned into a pained grunt, then cut off. Hooves beat a staccato upon marble as the sole survivor charged her enemies, shouting her patriotic fervor. For just a moment, this single pony held the line by herself. Luna was pretty sure she recognized this voice that snarled in the face of certain death. But even then, after a solid thirty seconds, she too fell, a whispered apology upon her last breath. Her body hit the wall and fell with a dull thud.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too, Li li, so so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d The apology from the Princess of the Night only fell on deceased ears. The other four Elements of Harmony stepped parallel to the Alicorn, faces set into grim lines and weapons at the ready. Yet, all was silent. Seconds lingered far longer than they should have. Were they preparing themselves? Did they think now, after five years of bloodshed, that they\xe2\x80\x99re quest was finally finished? Or were they waiting for a pony to react, one that was no longer with them on the mortal plane? Was there any reason at all to their twisted logic?\r\n\t\r\n\tFinally, the doors blew open, blasted clear off their hinges and sent careening into the closest walls. As the dust slowly cleared, the attackers entered the room, approaching slowly. Luna closed her eyes in sorrow.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got you now, traitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tNo attack came. She could feel the other Elements at her side, tensing, preparing for the inevitable fight.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOpen your eyes! I want you to see the ponies that brought you to your knees, tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna ignored them. She calmed her turbulent thoughts and took deep, slow breaths.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSweet Corona Flare, look at her. Basking in the glory of her decadent deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tA white hot flame burned within Luna\xe2\x80\x99s mind for the first time in days. She gulped down a shuddering breath and her eyes snapped open. There were only four of them. Flare\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted followers. Their gazes were hardened, stances battle ready. There were no traces of the decent ponies they once were. As Luna studied them, her anger rose sharply. Honestly, she did not feel sorry for these foals. As far as she was concerned, they were no longer her ponies. Just monsters.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how much pain I am in right now. How much pain you\xe2\x80\x99ve caused me over the course of the last five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tOne of them stepped forward. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who he had once been. His armor obscured his coat and cutie mark and his full helm hid his face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to hand us that pile of filth. Everyone knows how poorly you\xe2\x80\x99ve treated us Equestrians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAnother moved, a mare. \xe2\x80\x9cThose five years of fighting can be laid squarely at your hooves, tyrant. If you had cared all that much you would have given up the throne to our Mistress ages ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cEquestrian lives lost are all your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t"BE SILENT, KNAVE!" The Alicorn of the Night shook the entire castle with her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are no longer Equestrians! You forfeit all claims to that distinction when you joined that usurper and waged war upon my country! And it was all for naught, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?! You\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, now. Your Corona Flare no longer stalks this world, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a matter of time before you, too, fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tFor the first time, there seemed to be hesitation among the creatures arrayed before her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Mistress is completely fine! Merely resting after her fight with that damned Valkyrie of yours. I note that she\xe2\x80\x99s not here with you. Did she abandon you? Left you, tyrant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tMore anger reared its head, followed by cold smugness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife took your damn Mistress with her. Have you not felt it yet? Your powers slowly diminishing, your every step weakened? It is because the catalyst for your magic is gone. Gone for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThere was a shivering beat of icy silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie! Attack! Kill them! Kill them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe stallion who had stepped forward earlier led the charge, and the remaining Elements of Harmony moved to meet it head on. The first foe crashed directly into Halt, the stoic earth pony a solid wall of muscle and bristling steel. The Element of Honesty flared bright orange, encasing its owner in a faint glow. Spells fizzled against the protection not a single moment later, rebounding in random directions. Spitfire was next into the fray, leaping and diving above her grounded enemies. Loyalty offered its power to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s wings, turning the already formidable pegasus into a winged terror. Zecora found herself engaging two enemies at once, even as Laughter muddled their senses. And the medic Shimmer found her attention divided as she struggled to keep healing and energizing magic pumping into her allies. Watching the ponies she loved almost as much as her wife fighting for their continued freedom, something inside the dark princess snapped. Her willpower hardened, and then she charged into the battle herself even as more rebels charged up the corridor leading to the throne room.\r\n\t\r\n\tEven with the Elements of Harmony augmenting their abilities, the final defenders were still losing ground. Whatever fell magic Flare had used to enhance her best lieutenants was far more powerful than the splintered Elements. Without their full number the artifacts were quite a bit weaker, and with enemy reinforcements joining the fray it was only a matter of time at this point. Leaving the four monsters to her friends, Princess Luna immediately turned and met the newcomers at the doors. She lowered her head and ran one pony through with her horn, then turned and bucked another so hard Luna snapped the mare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Another leapt onto the Alcorn\'s back, sword skating uselessly against the reinforced half armor there. Luna leapt straight backwards and crushed the stallion into the wall.\r\n\t\r\n\tSlowly but surely, the defenders were pressed backwards, right up against the Equestrian Thrones. The five of them stood before those seats of power, refusing to give another inch of ground. Shimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were glowing with pink power, mouth transfixed into a permanent scowl as she struggled to pour as much healing magic as she could into her comrades. Scratches and other minor wounds knitted themselves as fast as they appeared. Spitfire was still airborne, trying to keep other flyers from taking out Shimmer while simultaneously creating small openings in the never ending tide. Halter had retrieved a two-handed hammer from a fallen foe and worked on making himself the biggest target possible in an effort to keep them away from his team. But the weakened Elements of Harmony were quickly tiring. Each of them knew it was only going to be a matter of time.\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna suddenly felt numerous magical signatures flaring at the same time; far too many to count. The next thing she knew, the throne room was suddenly filled with multiple flashes of light as teleports completed. The rebels found their attention divided as they were unexpectedly attacked on all sides by unicorns covered head to hoof in gleaming purple armor. Panicked cries were cut off as the purple armored ponies moved through the throne room, cutting down rebels with practiced ease. Those still alive and with their wits about them began to rapidly retreat, some even going so far as to drag their dead with them. The newcomers gave chase down the hall as even more teleports flared throughout the room. As Luna tried to catch her breath, she could only see one word emblazoned upon the armor: Magickaforce. The Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s elite commandos had arrived.\r\n\t\r\n\tOne of them approached the battered Elements of Harmony, one Luna recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d she greeted, bowing her head. Though the visor set in her helmet hid her face, Luna knew the badges upon the armor.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYour timing was impeccable, Knight-commander Bright Spark. A few moments more and Equestria would have fallen for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe came as soon as we could. When we discovered that the majority of Flare\xe2\x80\x99s forces were entrenched around Canterlot Palace, we knew what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re here at all, to be perfectly honest. I had thought the Magickaforce had disappeared with their liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tBright Spark shook her helmeted head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. However, we have been busy. Some of us were scouring the land, confirming without a doubt that she is gone. Others were in her laboratories, securing the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions and research. And even more of us were busy erasing all traces of her from history, and hopefully from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for? What reasons do you have to do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion she wanted to feel.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThose were her final orders to us. We were to make sure she was gone. We were to prevent others from finding her science, and claiming it as their own. And we were to make it appear like she had never existed in the first place. In a couple of years, Equestria will forget that there had been four Princesses ruling it, which is exactly what was planned. You will be hailed as the sole monarch, so that you may rebuild what was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will you go? Are you just going to toss aside your oaths, and return to living as normal ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Knight-commander actually laughed at that. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will go across the vast sea. We will take all of the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s research. Most of her inventions, that we feel most of ponykind aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll forge a new life in new lands. We will thrive. We will grow. And when our Mistress returns to the mortal plane once more, the Magickaforce will be ready. We will be prepared, and we will help her deal with Corona Flare for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no changing your mind, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not. It has already been decided, and while we do recognize you as a leader, Magickaforce only answers to one Princess, and one Princess only. Two if you count her sister. Right now, however, you need to tend to your comrades. Let us deal with the last of the insurgents. The least we can do is offer you a chance to start fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Princess Luna turned to check upon her fellow Elements of Harmony, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect upon what the future would bring. She had been given a chance, a golden opportunity to remake Equestria into something even better than it had been. And she knew her deceased wife deserved that much. Whenever the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s spirit regained a mortal shell, Luna would be waiting. So would the Magickaforce. And so would Equestria.\r\n', 'chapter_number': 10, 'parent_chapter_id': 713022, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'10\'></a><h3>Back to the Past 1</h3>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lone knock echoed around the spacious throne room. Princess Luna of Equestria tore her tear streaked gaze from the window and tried to compose herself.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice, still laced with grief hours later, was barely above a whisper.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ornate doors, depicting the four cutie marks of the Princesses of Equestria, opened slowly. A lone pony stepped through, one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Home Guard. The soldier carried something in his orange magic, objects that Luna recognized immediately. The once proud staff may have been splintered, the <i>Nightsteel</i> may have been tarnished from the rigors of war, but the glaive of the Valkyrie was still identifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found this, Princess. Its the only other part of her we\xe2\x80\x99ve found, save her armor.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chest constricted painfully, and it was all she could do to prevent herself from falling into helpless sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. She\xe2\x80\x99s truly gone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard removed his helmet and bowed his head, echoing the sorrow of his liege. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your highness. We did everything we could to find her and bring her back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna wiped her silently shed tears away almost angrily, then glanced up at the guard again. It was obvious that the Home Guard had seen some heavy, heavy fighting. Several cuts and bruises crisscrossed this one\xe2\x80\x99s face. His armor was dented and covered in a layer of grime. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should get out of here while you can. Get all of the remaining Home Guard out of Canterlot. Get away from this cursed place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already shaking his head, lips set into a determined frown. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, princess. The Home Guard will stand with our charge, just like we have always done in ages past.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an order from your princess: Withdraw. I will not let your lives be measured against mine. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already moving back towards the door, helmet sliding back into place. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere, Luna. We will guard the throne room. We will hold as long as we can. When those bastards break through, I hope the Home Guard will have weakened them enough for you to mop up their ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doors closed behind the guard with booming finality. Luna stared after him for several moments, before she realized he had set the remains of the weapon right next to the portal. Tears threatened to overcome her barriers yet again. When things went to Tartarus, <i>she</i> was the one there to keep her steady. <i>She</i> was the one to keep things mostly under control, battlehardened far beyond the other three Alicorns, including her sister. And now, she was gone. Her wife. Her other half. Her heart. Gone. There was a slight movement from behind Princess Luna, and she turned slowly.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There, standing proud as ever, were her four closest friends in the world. They were all making preparations, more than ready to stand with the last Princess of the Equestrian Crown. Captain Spitfire. Loyalty. Leader of the Wonderbolts fighting force and one of the most powerful pegasi to date. The physical embodiment of Loyalty hung about her neck, glinting blood red and shaped like her cutie mark. Zecora. Laughter. For being an unparalleled spymaster, the zebra had an astounding sense of humor and always took the opportunity to make others laugh. Sky blue graced her neck. Then came Shimmer. Kindness. The mare did everything in her power to aid those less fortunate, and still wore her medical coat with pride. Pink glimmered brightly. And finally, Halt. A pony so dependable and honest he would crawl through Tartarus and back for a friend.

Left you, tyrant?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More anger reared its head, followed by cold smugness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife took your damn Mistress with her. Have you not felt it yet? Your powers slowly diminishing, your every step weakened? It is because the catalyst for your magic is gone. Gone for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">There was a shivering beat of icy silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie! Attack! Kill them! Kill them all!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The stallion who had stepped forward earlier led the charge, and the remaining Elements of Harmony moved to meet it head on. The first foe crashed directly into Halt, the stoic earth pony a solid wall of muscle and bristling steel. The Element of Honesty flared bright orange, encasing its owner in a faint glow. Spells fizzled against the protection not a single moment later, rebounding in random directions. Spitfire was next into the fray, leaping and diving above her grounded enemies. Loyalty offered its power to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s wings, turning the already formidable pegasus into a winged terror. Zecora found herself engaging two enemies at once, even as Laughter muddled their senses. And the medic Shimmer found her attention divided as she struggled to keep healing and energizing magic pumping into her allies. Watching the ponies she loved almost as much as her wife fighting for their continued freedom, something inside the dark princess snapped. Her willpower hardened, and then she charged into the battle herself even as more rebels charged up the corridor leading to the throne room.</p><p class="indented double">Even with the Elements of Harmony augmenting their abilities, the final defenders were still losing ground. Whatever fell magic Flare had used to enhance her best lieutenants was far more powerful than the splintered Elements. Without their full number the artifacts were quite a bit weaker, and with enemy reinforcements joining the fray it was only a matter of time at this point. Leaving the four monsters to her friends, Princess Luna immediately turned and met the newcomers at the doors. She lowered her head and ran one pony through with her horn, then turned and bucked another so hard Luna snapped the mare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Another leapt onto the Alcorn&#039;s back, sword skating uselessly against the reinforced half armor there. Luna leapt straight backwards and crushed the stallion into the wall.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly but surely, the defenders were pressed backwards, right up against the Equestrian Thrones. The five of them stood before those seats of power, refusing to give another inch of ground. Shimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were glowing with pink power, mouth transfixed into a permanent scowl as she struggled to pour as much healing magic as she could into her comrades. Scratches and other minor wounds knitted themselves as fast as they appeared. Spitfire was still airborne, trying to keep other flyers from taking out Shimmer while simultaneously creating small openings in the never ending tide. Halter had retrieved a two-handed hammer from a fallen foe and worked on making himself the biggest target possible in an effort to keep them away from his team. But the weakened Elements of Harmony were quickly tiring. Each of them knew it was only going to be a matter of time.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna suddenly felt numerous magical signatures flaring at the same time; far too many to count. The next thing she knew, the throne room was suddenly filled with multiple flashes of light as teleports completed. The rebels found their attention divided as they were unexpectedly attacked on all sides by unicorns covered head to hoof in gleaming purple armor. Panicked cries were cut off as the purple armored ponies moved through the throne room, cutting down rebels with practiced ease. Those still alive and with their wits about them began to rapidly retreat, some even going so far as to drag their dead with them. The newcomers gave chase down the hall as even more teleports flared throughout the room. As Luna tried to catch her breath, she could only see one word emblazoned upon the armor: <i>Magickaforce</i>. The Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s elite commandos had arrived.</p><p class="indented double">One of them approached the battered Elements of Harmony, one Luna recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d she greeted, bowing her head. Though the visor set in her helmet hid her face, Luna knew the badges upon the armor.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYour timing was impeccable, Knight-commander Bright Spark. A few moments more and Equestria would have fallen for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe came as soon as we could. When we discovered that the majority of Flare\xe2\x80\x99s forces were entrenched around Canterlot Palace, we knew what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re here at all, to be perfectly honest. I had thought the <i>Magickaforce</i> had disappeared with their liege.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Bright Spark shook her helmeted head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. However, we have been busy. Some of us were scouring the land, confirming without a doubt that she is gone. Others were in her laboratories, securing the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions and research. And even more of us were busy erasing all traces of her from history, and hopefully from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for? What reasons do you have to do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion she wanted to feel.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThose were her final orders to us. We were to make sure she was gone. We were to prevent others from finding her science, and claiming it as their own. And we were to make it appear like she had never existed in the first place. In a couple of years, Equestria will forget that there had been four Princesses ruling it, which is exactly what was planned. <i>You</i> will be hailed as the sole monarch, so that you may rebuild what was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will you go? Are you just going to toss aside your oaths, and return to living as normal ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Knight-commander actually laughed at that. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will go across the vast sea. We will take all of the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s research. Most of her inventions, that we feel most of ponykind aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll forge a new life in new lands. We will thrive. We will grow. And when our Mistress returns to the mortal plane once more, the <i>Magickaforce</i> will be ready. We will be prepared, and we will help her deal with Corona Flare for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no changing your mind, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not. It has already been decided, and while we do recognize you as a leader, <i>Magickaforce</i> only answers to one Princess, and one Princess only. Two if you count her sister. Right now, however, you need to tend to your comrades. Let us deal with the last of the insurgents. The least we can do is offer you a chance to start fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As Princess Luna turned to check upon her fellow Elements of Harmony, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect upon what the future would bring. She had been given a chance, a golden opportunity to remake Equestria into something even better than it had been. And she knew her deceased wife deserved that much. Whenever the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s spirit regained a mortal shell, Luna would be waiting. So would the <i>Magickaforce</i>. And so would Equestria.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 104188}, 'chapter_id': 713022, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E3B6F0>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'10\'></a><h3>Back to the Past 1</h3>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lone knock echoed around the spacious throne room. Princess Luna of Equestria tore her tear streaked gaze from the window and tried to compose herself.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice, still laced with grief hours later, was barely above a whisper.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ornate doors, depicting the four cutie marks of the Princesses of Equestria, opened slowly. A lone pony stepped through, one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Home Guard. The soldier carried something in his orange magic, objects that Luna recognized immediately. The once proud staff may have been splintered, the <i>Nightsteel</i> may have been tarnished from the rigors of war, but the glaive of the Valkyrie was still identifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found this, Princess. Its the only other part of her we\xe2\x80\x99ve found, save her armor.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chest constricted painfully, and it was all she could do to prevent herself from falling into helpless sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. She\xe2\x80\x99s truly gone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard removed his helmet and bowed his head, echoing the sorrow of his liege. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your highness. We did everything we could to find her and bring her back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna wiped her silently shed tears away almost angrily, then glanced up at the guard again. It was obvious that the Home Guard had seen some heavy, heavy fighting. Several cuts and bruises crisscrossed this one\xe2\x80\x99s face. His armor was dented and covered in a layer of grime. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should get out of here while you can. Get all of the remaining Home Guard out of Canterlot. Get away from this cursed place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already shaking his head, lips set into a determined frown. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, princess. The Home Guard will stand with our charge, just like we have always done in ages past.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an order from your princess: Withdraw. I will not let your lives be measured against mine. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already moving back towards the door, helmet sliding back into place. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere, Luna. We will guard the throne room. We will hold as long as we can. When those bastards break through, I hope the Home Guard will have weakened them enough for you to mop up their ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doors closed behind the guard with booming finality. Luna stared after him for several moments, before she realized he had set the remains of the weapon right next to the portal. Tears threatened to overcome her barriers yet again. When things went to Tartarus, <i>she</i> was the one there to keep her steady. <i>She</i> was the one to keep things mostly under control, battlehardened far beyond the other three Alicorns, including her sister. And now, she was gone. Her wife. Her other half. Her heart. Gone. There was a slight movement from behind Princess Luna, and she turned slowly.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There, standing proud as ever, were her four closest friends in the world. They were all making preparations, more than ready to stand with the last Princess of the Equestrian Crown. Captain Spitfire. Loyalty. Leader of the Wonderbolts fighting force and one of the most powerful pegasi to date. The physical embodiment of Loyalty hung about her neck, glinting blood red and shaped like her cutie mark. Zecora. Laughter. For being an unparalleled spymaster, the zebra had an astounding sense of humor and always took the opportunity to make others laugh. Sky blue graced her neck. Then came Shimmer. Kindness. The mare did everything in her power to aid those less fortunate, and still wore her medical coat with pride. Pink glimmered brightly. And finally, Halt. A pony so dependable and honest he would crawl through Tartarus and back for a friend. Orange gleamed cheerfully.</p><p class="double">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna completed the fifth Element of Harmony. She was Generosity incarnate. How could she not be, with how she treated her subjects? Always spending resources from her own House to improve the lives of the average citizen, and never asking for a single thing in return. Dark purple shined against her black coat, right below her torc. The only Element missing was Magic. And this Element was the reason Luna\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom was on the verge of collapsing around her. With great power comes great responsibility, and her poor sister Celestia simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the power.</p><p class="indented double">&quot;I thought I made it clear that you four should not be here.&quot; Luna&#039;s stern voice was slightly ruined with tears still glimmering in her eyes.</p><p class="indented double">&quot;And I thought I had made it clear that we weren&#039;t going to be leaving our friend.&quot; Spitfire retorted. &quot;Never mind the fact that she&#039;s a princess.&quot;</p><p class="indented double">&quot;What&#039;s with all of my military personnel ignoring my orders?&quot; The dark Alicorn demanded, exasperated.</p><p class="indented double">&quot;Because you&#039;re making bad calls.&quot; Shimmer snapped. This gave Luna pause. The medical pony never talked like that. However, she rallied quickly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bad call to want to keep those I care about safe? Is it so wrong for me to wish for no more deaths at my hooves?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">&quot;Shimmer has a point.&quot; Halt added in his usual slow way. &quot;Even if we could get out of Canterlot, what then? We&#039;d be killed long before we could reach the border. And if by some miracle we&#039;re not, do you expect one of the other nations to harbor known &#039;terrorists&#039;? Nay. I say we test our mettle right here, standing in defiance against the evil that plagues us.&quot;</p><p class="indented double">Zecora didn&#039;t say anything, but then again she didn&#039;t have to. She was as ready for a fight as the rest of them. Luna stood there, mulling over their words. In hindsight, ordering them to abandon her and their home <i>was</i> a bit redundant. The sounds of fighting in the long hallway leading to the room suddenly reached her ears. She heard her Home Guard crying out in a single voice, shouting their fury to the world. Weapons clashed, magic cackled, and bodies slumped to the floor. The fighting was so very close now. Almost right on top of the closed doors. The captain of the Home Guard tried to rally his remaining ponies. His exclamation turned into a pained grunt, then cut off. Hooves beat a staccato upon marble as the sole survivor charged her enemies, shouting her patriotic fervor. For just a moment, this single pony held the line by herself. Luna was pretty sure she recognized this voice that snarled in the face of certain death. But even then, after a solid thirty seconds, she too fell, a whispered apology upon her last breath. Her body hit the wall and fell with a dull thud.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too, Li li, so so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d The apology from the Princess of the Night only fell on deceased ears. The other four Elements of Harmony stepped parallel to the Alicorn, faces set into grim lines and weapons at the ready. Yet, all was silent. Seconds lingered far longer than they should have. Were they preparing themselves? Did they think now, after five years of bloodshed, that they\xe2\x80\x99re quest was finally finished? Or were they waiting for a pony to react, one that was no longer with them on the mortal plane? Was there any reason at all to their twisted logic?</p><p class="indented double">Finally, the doors blew open, blasted clear off their hinges and sent careening into the closest walls. As the dust slowly cleared, the attackers entered the room, approaching slowly. Luna closed her eyes in sorrow.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got you now, traitors.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">No attack came. She could feel the other Elements at her side, tensing, preparing for the inevitable fight.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOpen your eyes! I want you to see the ponies that brought you to your knees, tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Luna ignored them. She calmed her turbulent thoughts and took deep, slow breaths.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cSweet Corona Flare, look at her. Basking in the glory of her decadent deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">A white hot flame burned within Luna\xe2\x80\x99s mind for the first time in days. She gulped down a shuddering breath and her eyes snapped open. There were only four of them. Flare\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted followers. Their gazes were hardened, stances battle ready. There were no traces of the decent ponies they once were. As Luna studied them, her anger rose sharply. Honestly, she did not feel sorry for these foals. As far as she was concerned, they were no longer her ponies. Just monsters.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how much pain I am in right now. How much pain you\xe2\x80\x99ve caused me over the course of the last five years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">One of them stepped forward. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who he had once been. His armor obscured his coat and cutie mark and his full helm hid his face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to hand us that pile of filth. Everyone knows how poorly you\xe2\x80\x99ve treated us Equestrians.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Another moved, a mare. \xe2\x80\x9cThose five years of fighting can be laid squarely at your hooves, tyrant. If you had cared all that much you would have given up the throne to our Mistress ages ago.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cEquestrian lives lost are all your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">&quot;<i><b>BE SILENT, KNAVE!</i></b>&quot; The Alicorn of the Night shook the entire castle with her voice. \xe2\x80\x9c<i><b>You are no longer Equestrians! You forfeit all claims to that distinction when you joined that usurper and waged war upon my country!</i></b> And it was all for naught, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?! You\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, now. Your Corona Flare no longer stalks this world, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a matter of time before you, too, fall.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">For the first time, there seemed to be hesitation among the creatures arrayed before her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?

Princess Luna of Equestria tore her tear streaked gaze from the window and tried to compose herself.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice, still laced with grief hours later, was barely above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ornate doors, depicting the four cutie marks of the Princesses of Equestria, opened slowly. A lone pony stepped through, one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Home Guard. The soldier carried something in his orange magic, objects that Luna recognized immediately. The once proud staff may have been splintered, the Nightsteel may have been tarnished from the rigors of war, but the glaive of the Valkyrie was still identifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found this, Princess.

She\xe2\x80\x99s truly gone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard removed his helmet and bowed his head, echoing the sorrow of his liege. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your highness. We did everything we could to find her and bring her back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna wiped her silently shed tears away almost angrily, then glanced up at the guard again. It was obvious that the Home Guard had seen some heavy, heavy fighting. Several cuts and bruises crisscrossed this one\xe2\x80\x99s face. His armor was dented and covered in a layer of grime. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should get out of here while you can. Get all of the remaining Home Guard out of Canterlot. Get away from this cursed place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already shaking his head, lips set into a determined frown. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, princess. The Home Guard will stand with our charge, just like we have always done in ages past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an order from your princess: Withdraw. I will not let your lives be measured against mine. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already moving back towards the door, helmet sliding back into place. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere, Luna. We will guard the throne room. We will hold as long as we can. When those bastards break through, I hope the Home Guard will have weakened them enough for you to mop up their ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doors closed behind the guard with booming finality. Luna stared after him for several moments, before she realized he had set the remains of the weapon right next to the portal. Tears threatened to overcome her barriers yet again. When things went to Tartarus, she was the one there to keep her steady. She was the one to keep things mostly under control, battlehardened far beyond the other three Alicorns, including her sister. And now, she was gone. Her wife. Her other half. Her heart. Gone. There was a slight movement from behind Princess Luna, and she turned slowly.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There, standing proud as ever, were her four closest friends in the world. They were all making preparations, more than ready to stand with the last Princess of the Equestrian Crown. Captain Spitfire. Loyalty. Leader of the Wonderbolts fighting force and one of the most powerful pegasi to date. The physical embodiment of Loyalty hung about her neck, glinting blood red and shaped like her cutie mark. Zecora. Laughter. For being an unparalleled spymaster, the zebra had an astounding sense of humor and always took the opportunity to make others laugh. Sky blue graced her neck. Then came Shimmer. Kindness. The mare did everything in her power to aid those less fortunate, and still wore her medical coat with pride. Pink glimmered brightly. And finally, Halt. A pony so dependable and honest he would crawl through Tartarus and back for a friend. Orange gleamed cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna completed the fifth Element of Harmony. She was Generosity incarnate. How could she not be, with how she treated her subjects? Always spending resources from her own House to improve the lives of the average citizen, and never asking for a single thing in return. Dark purple shined against her black coat, right below her torc. The only Element missing was Magic. And this Element was the reason Luna\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom was on the verge of collapsing around her. With great power comes great responsibility, and her poor sister Celestia simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the power.\r\n\r\n\t"I thought I made it clear that you four should not be here." Luna\'s stern voice was slightly ruined with tears still glimmering in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\t"And I thought I had made it clear that we weren\'t going to be leaving our friend." Spitfire retorted. "Never mind the fact that she\'s a princess."\r\n\r\n\t"What\'s with all of my military personnel ignoring my orders?" The dark Alicorn demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\n\t"Because you\'re making bad calls." Shimmer snapped. This gave Luna pause. The medical pony never talked like that. However, she rallied quickly.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bad call to want to keep those I care about safe? Is it so wrong for me to wish for no more deaths at my hooves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t"Shimmer has a point." Halt added in his usual slow way. "Even if we could get out of Canterlot, what then? We\'d be killed long before we could reach the border. And if by some miracle we\'re not, do you expect one of the other nations to harbor known \'terrorists\'? Nay. I say we test our mettle right here, standing in defiance against the evil that plagues us."\r\n\r\n\tZecora didn\'t say anything, but then again she didn\'t have to. She was as ready for a fight as the rest of them. Luna stood there, mulling over their words. In hindsight, ordering them to abandon her and their home was a bit redundant. The sounds of fighting in the long hallway leading to the room suddenly reached her ears. She heard her Home Guard crying out in a single voice, shouting their fury to the world. Weapons clashed, magic cackled, and bodies slumped to the floor. The fighting was so very close now. Almost right on top of the closed doors. The captain of the Home Guard tried to rally his remaining ponies. His exclamation turned into a pained grunt, then cut off. Hooves beat a staccato upon marble as the sole survivor charged her enemies, shouting her patriotic fervor. For just a moment, this single pony held the line by herself. Luna was pretty sure she recognized this voice that snarled in the face of certain death. But even then, after a solid thirty seconds, she too fell, a whispered apology upon her last breath. Her body hit the wall and fell with a dull thud.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too, Li li, so so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d The apology from the Princess of the Night only fell on deceased ears. The other four Elements of Harmony stepped parallel to the Alicorn, faces set into grim lines and weapons at the ready. Yet, all was silent. Seconds lingered far longer than they should have. Were they preparing themselves? Did they think now, after five years of bloodshed, that they\xe2\x80\x99re quest was finally finished? Or were they waiting for a pony to react, one that was no longer with them on the mortal plane? Was there any reason at all to their twisted logic?\r\n\t\r\n\tFinally, the doors blew open, blasted clear off their hinges and sent careening into the closest walls. As the dust slowly cleared, the attackers entered the room, approaching slowly. Luna closed her eyes in sorrow.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got you now, traitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tNo attack came. She could feel the other Elements at her side, tensing, preparing for the inevitable fight.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOpen your eyes! I want you to see the ponies that brought you to your knees, tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tLuna ignored them. She calmed her turbulent thoughts and took deep, slow breaths.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cSweet Corona Flare, look at her. Basking in the glory of her decadent deeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tA white hot flame burned within Luna\xe2\x80\x99s mind for the first time in days. She gulped down a shuddering breath and her eyes snapped open. There were only four of them. Flare\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted followers. Their gazes were hardened, stances battle ready. There were no traces of the decent ponies they once were. As Luna studied them, her anger rose sharply. Honestly, she did not feel sorry for these foals. As far as she was concerned, they were no longer her ponies. Just monsters.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how much pain I am in right now. How much pain you\xe2\x80\x99ve caused me over the course of the last five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tOne of them stepped forward. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who he had once been. His armor obscured his coat and cutie mark and his full helm hid his face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to hand us that pile of filth. Everyone knows how poorly you\xe2\x80\x99ve treated us Equestrians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAnother moved, a mare. \xe2\x80\x9cThose five years of fighting can be laid squarely at your hooves, tyrant. If you had cared all that much you would have given up the throne to our Mistress ages ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cEquestrian lives lost are all your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t"BE SILENT, KNAVE!" The Alicorn of the Night shook the entire castle with her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are no longer Equestrians! You forfeit all claims to that distinction when you joined that usurper and waged war upon my country! And it was all for naught, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?! You\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, now. Your Corona Flare no longer stalks this world, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a matter of time before you, too, fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tFor the first time, there seemed to be hesitation among the creatures arrayed before her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Mistress is completely fine! Merely resting after her fight with that damned Valkyrie of yours. I note that she\xe2\x80\x99s not here with you. Did she abandon you? Left you, tyrant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tMore anger reared its head, followed by cold smugness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife took your damn Mistress with her. Have you not felt it yet? Your powers slowly diminishing, your every step weakened? It is because the catalyst for your magic is gone. Gone for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThere was a shivering beat of icy silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie! Attack! Kill them! Kill them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe stallion who had stepped forward earlier led the charge, and the remaining Elements of Harmony moved to meet it head on. The first foe crashed directly into Halt, the stoic earth pony a solid wall of muscle and bristling steel. The Element of Honesty flared bright orange, encasing its owner in a faint glow. Spells fizzled against the protection not a single moment later, rebounding in random directions. Spitfire was next into the fray, leaping and diving above her grounded enemies. Loyalty offered its power to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s wings, turning the already formidable pegasus into a winged terror. Zecora found herself engaging two enemies at once, even as Laughter muddled their senses. And the medic Shimmer found her attention divided as she struggled to keep healing and energizing magic pumping into her allies. Watching the ponies she loved almost as much as her wife fighting for their continued freedom, something inside the dark princess snapped. Her willpower hardened, and then she charged into the battle herself even as more rebels charged up the corridor leading to the throne room.\r\n\t\r\n\tEven with the Elements of Harmony augmenting their abilities, the final defenders were still losing ground. Whatever fell magic Flare had used to enhance her best lieutenants was far more powerful than the splintered Elements. Without their full number the artifacts were quite a bit weaker, and with enemy reinforcements joining the fray it was only a matter of time at this point. Leaving the four monsters to her friends, Princess Luna immediately turned and met the newcomers at the doors. She lowered her head and ran one pony through with her horn, then turned and bucked another so hard Luna snapped the mare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Another leapt onto the Alcorn\'s back, sword skating uselessly against the reinforced half armor there. Luna leapt straight backwards and crushed the stallion into the wall.\r\n\t\r\n\tSlowly but surely, the defenders were pressed backwards, right up against the Equestrian Thrones. The five of them stood before those seats of power, refusing to give another inch of ground. Shimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were glowing with pink power, mouth transfixed into a permanent scowl as she struggled to pour as much healing magic as she could into her comrades. Scratches and other minor wounds knitted themselves as fast as they appeared. Spitfire was still airborne, trying to keep other flyers from taking out Shimmer while simultaneously creating small openings in the never ending tide. Halter had retrieved a two-handed hammer from a fallen foe and worked on making himself the biggest target possible in an effort to keep them away from his team. But the weakened Elements of Harmony were quickly tiring. Each of them knew it was only going to be a matter of time.\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna suddenly felt numerous magical signatures flaring at the same time; far too many to count. The next thing she knew, the throne room was suddenly filled with multiple flashes of light as teleports completed. The rebels found their attention divided as they were unexpectedly attacked on all sides by unicorns covered head to hoof in gleaming purple armor. Panicked cries were cut off as the purple armored ponies moved through the throne room, cutting down rebels with practiced ease. Those still alive and with their wits about them began to rapidly retreat, some even going so far as to drag their dead with them. The newcomers gave chase down the hall as even more teleports flared throughout the room. As Luna tried to catch her breath, she could only see one word emblazoned upon the armor: Magickaforce. The Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s elite commandos had arrived.\r\n\t\r\n\tOne of them approached the battered Elements of Harmony, one Luna recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d she greeted, bowing her head. Though the visor set in her helmet hid her face, Luna knew the badges upon the armor.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYour timing was impeccable, Knight-commander Bright Spark. A few moments more and Equestria would have fallen for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe came as soon as we could. When we discovered that the majority of Flare\xe2\x80\x99s forces were entrenched around Canterlot Palace, we knew what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re here at all, to be perfectly honest. I had thought the Magickaforce had disappeared with their liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tBright Spark shook her helmeted head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. However, we have been busy. Some of us were scouring the land, confirming without a doubt that she is gone. Others were in her laboratories, securing the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions and research. And even more of us were busy erasing all traces of her from history, and hopefully from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for? What reasons do you have to do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion she wanted to feel.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThose were her final orders to us. We were to make sure she was gone. We were to prevent others from finding her science, and claiming it as their own. And we were to make it appear like she had never existed in the first place. In a couple of years, Equestria will forget that there had been four Princesses ruling it, which is exactly what was planned. You will be hailed as the sole monarch, so that you may rebuild what was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will you go? Are you just going to toss aside your oaths, and return to living as normal ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Knight-commander actually laughed at that. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will go across the vast sea. We will take all of the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s research. Most of her inventions, that we feel most of ponykind aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll forge a new life in new lands. We will thrive. We will grow. And when our Mistress returns to the mortal plane once more, the Magickaforce will be ready. We will be prepared, and we will help her deal with Corona Flare for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no changing your mind, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not. It has already been decided, and while we do recognize you as a leader, Magickaforce only answers to one Princess, and one Princess only. Two if you count her sister. Right now, however, you need to tend to your comrades. Let us deal with the last of the insurgents. The least we can do is offer you a chance to start fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Princess Luna turned to check upon her fellow Elements of Harmony, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect upon what the future would bring. She had been given a chance, a golden opportunity to remake Equestria into something even better than it had been. And she knew her deceased wife deserved that much. Whenever the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s spirit regained a mortal shell, Luna would be waiting. So would the Magickaforce. And so would Equestria.\r\n', 10, 713022, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/104188/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Flicka+Ravenhide">Flicka Ravenhide</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'10\'></a><h3>Back to the Past 1</h3>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lone knock echoed around the spacious throne room.

She was as ready for a fight as the rest of them. Luna stood there, mulling over their words. In hindsight, ordering them to abandon her and their home <i>was</i> a bit redundant. The sounds of fighting in the long hallway leading to the room suddenly reached her ears. She heard her Home Guard crying out in a single voice, shouting their fury to the world. Weapons clashed, magic cackled, and bodies slumped to the floor. The fighting was so very close now. Almost right on top of the closed doors. The captain of the Home Guard tried to rally his remaining ponies. His exclamation turned into a pained grunt, then cut off. Hooves beat a staccato upon marble as the sole survivor charged her enemies, shouting her patriotic fervor. For just a moment, this single pony held the line by herself. Luna was pretty sure she recognized this voice that snarled in the face of certain death. But even then, after a solid thirty seconds, she too fell, a whispered apology upon her last breath. Her body hit the wall and fell with a dull thud.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too, Li li, so so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d The apology from the Princess of the Night only fell on deceased ears. The other four Elements of Harmony stepped parallel to the Alicorn, faces set into grim lines and weapons at the ready. Yet, all was silent. Seconds lingered far longer than they should have. Were they preparing themselves? Did they think now, after five years of bloodshed, that they\xe2\x80\x99re quest was finally finished? Or were they waiting for a pony to react, one that was no longer with them on the mortal plane? Was there any reason at all to their twisted logic?</p><p class="indented double">Finally, the doors blew open, blasted clear off their hinges and sent careening into the closest walls. As the dust slowly cleared, the attackers entered the room, approaching slowly. Luna closed her eyes in sorrow.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got you now, traitors.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">No attack came.

She gulped down a shuddering breath and her eyes snapped open. There were only four of them. Flare\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted followers. Their gazes were hardened, stances battle ready. There were no traces of the decent ponies they once were. As Luna studied them, her anger rose sharply. Honestly, she did not feel sorry for these foals. As far as she was concerned, they were no longer her ponies. Just monsters.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how much pain I am in right now. How much pain you\xe2\x80\x99ve caused me over the course of the last five years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">One of them stepped forward. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who he had once been. His armor obscured his coat and cutie mark and his full helm hid his face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to hand us that pile of filth.

Your Corona Flare no longer stalks this world, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a matter of time before you, too, fall.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">For the first time, there seemed to be hesitation among the creatures arrayed before her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Mistress is completely fine! Merely resting after her fight with that damned Valkyrie of yours. I note that she\xe2\x80\x99s not here with you. Did she abandon you? Left you, tyrant?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">More anger reared its head, followed by cold smugness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife took your damn Mistress with her. Have you not felt it yet? Your powers slowly diminishing, your every step weakened? It is because the catalyst for your magic is gone. Gone for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">There was a shivering beat of icy silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie! Attack! Kill them! Kill them all!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The stallion who had stepped forward earlier led the charge, and the remaining Elements of Harmony moved to meet it head on. The first foe crashed directly into Halt, the stoic earth pony a solid wall of muscle and bristling steel. The Element of Honesty flared bright orange, encasing its owner in a faint glow. Spells fizzled against the protection not a single moment later, rebounding in random directions. Spitfire was next into the fray, leaping and diving above her grounded enemies. Loyalty offered its power to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s wings, turning the already formidable pegasus into a winged terror. Zecora found herself engaging two enemies at once, even as Laughter muddled their senses. And the medic Shimmer found her attention divided as she struggled to keep healing and energizing magic pumping into her allies. Watching the ponies she loved almost as much as her wife fighting for their continued freedom, something inside the dark princess snapped. Her willpower hardened, and then she charged into the battle herself even as more rebels charged up the corridor leading to the throne room.</p><p class="indented double">Even with the Elements of Harmony augmenting their abilities, the final defenders were still losing ground. Whatever fell magic Flare had used to enhance her best lieutenants was far more powerful than the splintered Elements. Without their full number the artifacts were quite a bit weaker, and with enemy reinforcements joining the fray it was only a matter of time at this point. Leaving the four monsters to her friends, Princess Luna immediately turned and met the newcomers at the doors. She lowered her head and ran one pony through with her horn, then turned and bucked another so hard Luna snapped the mare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Another leapt onto the Alcorn&#039;s back, sword skating uselessly against the reinforced half armor there. Luna leapt straight backwards and crushed the stallion into the wall.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly but surely, the defenders were pressed backwards, right up against the Equestrian Thrones. The five of them stood before those seats of power, refusing to give another inch of ground. Shimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were glowing with pink power, mouth transfixed into a permanent scowl as she struggled to pour as much healing magic as she could into her comrades. Scratches and other minor wounds knitted themselves as fast as they appeared. Spitfire was still airborne, trying to keep other flyers from taking out Shimmer while simultaneously creating small openings in the never ending tide. Halter had retrieved a two-handed hammer from a fallen foe and worked on making himself the biggest target possible in an effort to keep them away from his team. But the weakened Elements of Harmony were quickly tiring. Each of them knew it was only going to be a matter of time.</p><p class="indented double">Princess Luna suddenly felt numerous magical signatures flaring at the same time; far too many to count. The next thing she knew, the throne room was suddenly filled with multiple flashes of light as teleports completed. The rebels found their attention divided as they were unexpectedly attacked on all sides by unicorns covered head to hoof in gleaming purple armor. Panicked cries were cut off as the purple armored ponies moved through the throne room, cutting down rebels with practiced ease. Those still alive and with their wits about them began to rapidly retreat, some even going so far as to drag their dead with them. The newcomers gave chase down the hall as even more teleports flared throughout the room. As Luna tried to catch her breath, she could only see one word emblazoned upon the armor: <i>Magickaforce</i>. The Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s elite commandos had arrived.</p><p class="indented double">One of them approached the battered Elements of Harmony, one Luna recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d she greeted, bowing her head. Though the visor set in her helmet hid her face, Luna knew the badges upon the armor.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cYour timing was impeccable, Knight-commander Bright Spark. A few moments more and Equestria would have fallen for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe came as soon as we could. When we discovered that the majority of Flare\xe2\x80\x99s forces were entrenched around Canterlot Palace, we knew what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re here at all, to be perfectly honest. I had thought the <i>Magickaforce</i> had disappeared with their liege.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Bright Spark shook her helmeted head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. However, we have been busy. Some of us were scouring the land, confirming without a doubt that she is gone. Others were in her laboratories, securing the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions and research. And even more of us were busy erasing all traces of her from history, and hopefully from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for? What reasons do you have to do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion she wanted to feel.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThose were her final orders to us. We were to make sure she was gone. We were to prevent others from finding her science, and claiming it as their own. And we were to make it appear like she had never existed in the first place. In a couple of years, Equestria will forget that there had been four Princesses ruling it, which is exactly what was planned. <i>You</i> will be hailed as the sole monarch, so that you may rebuild what was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will you go? Are you just going to toss aside your oaths, and return to living as normal ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">The Knight-commander actually laughed at that. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will go across the vast sea. We will take all of the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s research. Most of her inventions, that we feel most of ponykind aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll forge a new life in new lands. We will thrive. We will grow. And when our Mistress returns to the mortal plane once more, the <i>Magickaforce</i> will be ready. We will be prepared, and we will help her deal with Corona Flare for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no changing your mind, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not. It has already been decided, and while we do recognize you as a leader, <i>Magickaforce</i> only answers to one Princess, and one Princess only. Two if you count her sister. Right now, however, you need to tend to your comrades. Let us deal with the last of the insurgents. The least we can do is offer you a chance to start fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As Princess Luna turned to check upon her fellow Elements of Harmony, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect upon what the future would bring. She had been given a chance, a golden opportunity to remake Equestria into something even better than it had been. And she knew her deceased wife deserved that much. Whenever the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s spirit regained a mortal shell, Luna would be waiting. So would the <i>Magickaforce</i>. And so would Equestria.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 104188], 'parent_story_id': 104188, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// Back to the Past 1// Story: Valkyrie// by Flicka Ravenhide//------------------------------//\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lone knock echoed around the spacious throne room. Princess Luna of Equestria tore her tear streaked gaze from the window and tried to compose herself.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEnter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice, still laced with grief hours later, was barely above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ornate doors, depicting the four cutie marks of the Princesses of Equestria, opened slowly. A lone pony stepped through, one of Luna\xe2\x80\x99s Home Guard. The soldier carried something in his orange magic, objects that Luna recognized immediately. The once proud staff may have been splintered, the Nightsteel may have been tarnished from the rigors of war, but the glaive of the Valkyrie was still identifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found this, Princess. Its the only other part of her we\xe2\x80\x99ve found, save her armor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna\xe2\x80\x99s chest constricted painfully, and it was all she could do to prevent herself from falling into helpless sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. She\xe2\x80\x99s truly gone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard removed his helmet and bowed his head, echoing the sorrow of his liege. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your highness. We did everything we could to find her and bring her back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna wiped her silently shed tears away almost angrily, then glanced up at the guard again. It was obvious that the Home Guard had seen some heavy, heavy fighting. Several cuts and bruises crisscrossed this one\xe2\x80\x99s face. His armor was dented and covered in a layer of grime. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should get out of here while you can. Get all of the remaining Home Guard out of Canterlot. Get away from this cursed place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already shaking his head, lips set into a determined frown. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, princess. The Home Guard will stand with our charge, just like we have always done in ages past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an order from your princess: Withdraw. I will not let your lives be measured against mine. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guard was already moving back towards the door, helmet sliding back into place. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere, Luna. We will guard the throne room. We will hold as long as we can. When those bastards break through, I hope the Home Guard will have weakened them enough for you to mop up their ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doors closed behind the guard with booming finality. Luna stared after him for several moments, before she realized he had set the remains of the weapon right next to the portal. Tears threatened to overcome her barriers yet again. When things went to Tartarus, she was the one there to keep her steady. She was the one to keep things mostly under control, battlehardened far beyond the other three Alicorns, including her sister. And now, she was gone. Her wife. Her other half. Her heart. Gone. There was a slight movement from behind Princess Luna, and she turned slowly.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There, standing proud as ever, were her four closest friends in the world. They were all making preparations, more than ready to stand with the last Princess of the Equestrian Crown. Captain Spitfire. Loyalty. Leader of the Wonderbolts fighting force and one of the most powerful pegasi to date. The physical embodiment of Loyalty hung about her neck, glinting blood red and shaped like her cutie mark. Zecora. Laughter. For being an unparalleled spymaster, the zebra had an astounding sense of humor and always took the opportunity to make others laugh. Sky blue graced her neck. Then came Shimmer. Kindness. The mare did everything in her power to aid those less fortunate, and still wore her medical coat with pride. Pink glimmered brightly. And finally, Halt. A pony so dependable and honest he would crawl through Tartarus and back for a friend. Orange gleamed cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Luna completed the fifth Element of Harmony. She was Generosity incarnate.

"Never mind the fact that she\'s a princess."\r\n\r\n\t"What\'s with all of my military personnel ignoring my orders?" The dark Alicorn demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\n\t"Because you\'re making bad calls." Shimmer snapped. This gave Luna pause. The medical pony never talked like that. However, she rallied quickly.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bad call to want to keep those I care about safe? Is it so wrong for me to wish for no more deaths at my hooves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\t"Shimmer has a point." Halt added in his usual slow way. "Even if we could get out of Canterlot, what then?

The first foe crashed directly into Halt, the stoic earth pony a solid wall of muscle and bristling steel. The Element of Honesty flared bright orange, encasing its owner in a faint glow. Spells fizzled against the protection not a single moment later, rebounding in random directions. Spitfire was next into the fray, leaping and diving above her grounded enemies. Loyalty offered its power to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s wings, turning the already formidable pegasus into a winged terror. Zecora found herself engaging two enemies at once, even as Laughter muddled their senses. And the medic Shimmer found her attention divided as she struggled to keep healing and energizing magic pumping into her allies. Watching the ponies she loved almost as much as her wife fighting for their continued freedom, something inside the dark princess snapped. Her willpower hardened, and then she charged into the battle herself even as more rebels charged up the corridor leading to the throne room.\r\n\t\r\n\tEven with the Elements of Harmony augmenting their abilities, the final defenders were still losing ground. Whatever fell magic Flare had used to enhance her best lieutenants was far more powerful than the splintered Elements. Without their full number the artifacts were quite a bit weaker, and with enemy reinforcements joining the fray it was only a matter of time at this point. Leaving the four monsters to her friends, Princess Luna immediately turned and met the newcomers at the doors. She lowered her head and ran one pony through with her horn, then turned and bucked another so hard Luna snapped the mare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Another leapt onto the Alcorn\'s back, sword skating uselessly against the reinforced half armor there. Luna leapt straight backwards and crushed the stallion into the wall.\r\n\t\r\n\tSlowly but surely, the defenders were pressed backwards, right up against the Equestrian Thrones. The five of them stood before those seats of power, refusing to give another inch of ground. Shimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were glowing with pink power, mouth transfixed into a permanent scowl as she struggled to pour as much healing magic as she could into her comrades. Scratches and other minor wounds knitted themselves as fast as they appeared. Spitfire was still airborne, trying to keep other flyers from taking out Shimmer while simultaneously creating small openings in the never ending tide. Halter had retrieved a two-handed hammer from a fallen foe and worked on making himself the biggest target possible in an effort to keep them away from his team. But the weakened Elements of Harmony were quickly tiring. Each of them knew it was only going to be a matter of time.\r\n\t\r\n\tPrincess Luna suddenly felt numerous magical signatures flaring at the same time; far too many to count. The next thing she knew, the throne room was suddenly filled with multiple flashes of light as teleports completed. The rebels found their attention divided as they were unexpectedly attacked on all sides by unicorns covered head to hoof in gleaming purple armor. Panicked cries were cut off as the purple armored ponies moved through the throne room, cutting down rebels with practiced ease. Those still alive and with their wits about them began to rapidly retreat, some even going so far as to drag their dead with them. The newcomers gave chase down the hall as even more teleports flared throughout the room. As Luna tried to catch her breath, she could only see one word emblazoned upon the armor: Magickaforce. The Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s elite commandos had arrived.\r\n\t\r\n\tOne of them approached the battered Elements of Harmony, one Luna recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d she greeted, bowing her head. Though the visor set in her helmet hid her face, Luna knew the badges upon the armor.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYour timing was impeccable, Knight-commander Bright Spark. A few moments more and Equestria would have fallen for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe came as soon as we could. When we discovered that the majority of Flare\xe2\x80\x99s forces were entrenched around Canterlot Palace, we knew what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99re here at all, to be perfectly honest. I had thought the Magickaforce had disappeared with their liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tBright Spark shook her helmeted head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. However, we have been busy. Some of us were scouring the land, confirming without a doubt that she is gone. Others were in her laboratories, securing the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions and research. And even more of us were busy erasing all traces of her from history, and hopefully from memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for? What reasons do you have to do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide what emotion she wanted to feel.\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThose were her final orders to us. We were to make sure she was gone. We were to prevent others from finding her science, and claiming it as their own. And we were to make it appear like she had never existed in the first place. In a couple of years, Equestria will forget that there had been four Princesses ruling it, which is exactly what was planned. You will be hailed as the sole monarch, so that you may rebuild what was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will you go? Are you just going to toss aside your oaths, and return to living as normal ponies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Knight-commander actually laughed at that. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will go across the vast sea. We will take all of the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s research. Most of her inventions, that we feel most of ponykind aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll forge a new life in new lands. We will thrive. We will grow. And when our Mistress returns to the mortal plane once more, the Magickaforce will be ready. We will be prepared, and we will help her deal with Corona Flare for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no changing your mind, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not. It has already been decided, and while we do recognize you as a leader, Magickaforce only answers to one Princess, and one Princess only. Two if you count her sister. Right now, however, you need to tend to your comrades. Let us deal with the last of the insurgents. The least we can do is offer you a chance to start fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\t\r\n\tAs Princess Luna turned to check upon her fellow Elements of Harmony, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect upon what the future would bring. She had been given a chance, a golden opportunity to remake Equestria into something even better than it had been. And she knew her deceased wife deserved that much. Whenever the Valkyrie\xe2\x80\x99s spirit regained a mortal shell, Luna would be waiting. So would the Magickaforce. And so would Equestria.\r\n', 'epub': None}

Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.\n\nIt had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.\n\nAnd, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.\n\nTrixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.\n\nNevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. \n\nAt first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.\n\nIt was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. \n\nEverypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.\n\nGetting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.\n\nTaking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?\n\nAnd it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.\n\nTo tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. \n\nLuna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.\n\nAnd yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.\n\nShe would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.\n\nThe only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.\n\nAt that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.\n\nLuna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\nThe mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.\n\nLuna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.\n\nLuna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGood, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. \n\nFor the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. \n\nWhat neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.\n\nAs she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.\n\nAfter a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. \n\nLuna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.\n\nLuna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.\n\nLuna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCelestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. \n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.\n\nOnce Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.\n\nAfter a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.\n\nTrixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. \n\nLuna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. \n\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.\n\nTrixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.\n\nTrixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.\n\nLuna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBefore Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. \n\nTrixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\n\nLuna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. \n\nLuna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.\n\nAs she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. \n\nYelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.\n\nLuna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. \n\nAnother moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.\n\nEager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.\n\nStopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.\n\nThe two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.\n\nLuna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.\n\nSeemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.\n \nCelestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her\n.\nLuna hit her head on the closest wall.\n\n***\n\nThis was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\nTrixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.\n\nTrixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. \n\nLuna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. \n\nLuna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.\n\nAs Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.\n\nTrixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.\n\nLuna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. \n\nLuna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.\n\nLuna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.\n\nThe alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.\n\nLuna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.\n\nLuna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. \n\nThe blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.\n\nThe mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. \n\nLuna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.\n\nFrom behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn to face her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a voice that contained no sorrow whatsoever. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes things happen. She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna let her head hit the floor.\n', 'chapter_number': 1, 'parent_chapter_id': 11, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/10/accolade">Accolade</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Cereal+Velocity">Cereal Velocity</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Accolade</h3>\n<p><i>Your heart is my pi\xc3\xb1ata.</p><p><b>Chuck Palahniuk</b></p><p></i>\t\t</p><p>Asking for help was not something the Great and Powerful Trixie was used to doing. Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.</p><p class="double">It had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.</p><p class="double">And, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. </p><p class="double">At first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.</p><p class="double">It was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. </p><p class="double">Everypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.</p><p class="double">Getting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.</p><p class="double">Taking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?</p><p class="double">And it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.</p><p class="double">To tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. </p><p class="double">Luna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.</p><p class="double">And yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.</p><p class="double">She would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.</p><p class="double">The only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.</p><p class="double">At that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.</p><p class="double">Luna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p><p class="double">The mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.</p><p class="double"> \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.</p><p class="double">Luna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.</p><p class="double">Luna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Good, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. </p><p class="double">For the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. </p><p class="double">What neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">It was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.</p><p class="double">As she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. </p><p class="double">Luna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.</p><p class="double">The two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.</p><p class="double">Luna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.</p><p class="double">Luna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Celestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Under any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. </p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.</p><p class="double">Once Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.</p><p class="double">After a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. </p><p class="double">Luna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. </p><p class="double">She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.</p><p class="double">Trixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.</p><p class="double">Trixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.</p><p class="double">Luna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Before Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. </p><p class="double">Trixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.</p><p class="double">Luna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. </p><p class="double">Luna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.</p><p class="double">As she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. </p><p class="double">Yelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.</p><p class="double">Luna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. </p><p class="double">Another moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.</p><p class="double">Eager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.</p><p class="double">Stopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.</p><p class="double">The two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.</p><p class="double">Luna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.</p><p class="double">Seemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her</p><p>.</p><p>Luna hit her head on the closest wall.</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">This was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.</p><p class="double">Trixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. </p><p class="double">Luna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. </p><p class="double">Luna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.</p><p class="double">As Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.</p><p class="double">Trixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.</p><p class="double">Luna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. </p><p class="double">Luna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.</p><p class="double">Luna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.</p><p class="double">The alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.</p><p class="double">Luna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. </p><p class="double">The blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.</p><p class="double">The mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. </p><p class="double">Luna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.</p><p class="double">From behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached.

She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna let her head hit the floor.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 10}, 'chapter_id': 11, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E43F50>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/10/accolade">Accolade</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Cereal+Velocity">Cereal Velocity</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Accolade</h3>\n<p><i>Your heart is my pi\xc3\xb1ata.</p><p><b>Chuck Palahniuk</b></p><p></i>\t\t</p><p>Asking for help was not something the Great and Powerful Trixie was used to doing. Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.</p><p class="double">It had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.</p><p class="double">And, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. </p><p class="double">At first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.</p><p class="double">It was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. </p><p class="double">Everypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.</p><p class="double">Getting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.</p><p class="double">Taking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?</p><p class="double">And it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.</p><p class="double">To tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. </p><p class="double">Luna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.</p><p class="double">And yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.</p><p class="double">She would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.</p><p class="double">The only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.</p><p class="double">At that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.</p><p class="double">Luna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p><p class="double">The mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.</p><p class="double"> \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.</p><p class="double">Luna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.</p><p class="double">Luna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Good, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. </p><p class="double">For the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. </p><p class="double">What neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">It was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.</p><p class="double">As she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. </p><p class="double">Luna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.</p><p class="double">The two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.</p><p class="double">Luna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.</p><p class="double">Luna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Celestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Under any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. </p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.</p><p class="double">Once Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.</p><p class="double">After a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. </p><p class="double">Luna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. </p><p class="double">She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.</p><p class="double">Trixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.</p><p class="double">Trixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.</p><p class="double">Luna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Before Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. </p><p class="double">Trixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.</p><p class="double">Luna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. </p><p class="double">Luna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.</p><p class="double">As she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. </p><p class="double">Yelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.</p><p class="double">Luna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. </p><p class="double">Another moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.</p><p class="double">Eager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.</p><p class="double">Stopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.</p><p class="double">The two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.</p><p class="double">Luna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.</p><p class="double">Seemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her</p><p>.</p><p>Luna hit her head on the closest wall.</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">This was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.</p><p class="double">Trixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. </p><p class="double">Luna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. </p><p class="double">Luna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.</p><p class="double">As Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.</p><p class="double">Trixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.</p><p class="double">Luna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. </p><p class="double">Luna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.</p><p class="double">Luna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.</p><p class="double">The alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.</p><p class="double">Luna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. </p><p class="double">The blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.</p><p class="double">The mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. </p><p class="double">Luna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.</p><p class="double">From behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn to face her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a voice that contained no sorrow whatsoever. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes things happen. She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna let her head hit the floor.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// Accolade// Story: Accolade// by Cereal Velocity//------------------------------//\n\nYour heart is my pi\xc3\xb1ata.\nChuck Palahniuk\n\t\t\nAsking for help was not something the Great and Powerful Trixie was used to doing. Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.\n\nIt had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.\n\nAnd, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.\n\nTrixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.\n\nNevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. \n\nAt first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.\n\nIt was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. \n\nEverypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.\n\nGetting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.\n\nTaking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?\n\nAnd it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.\n\nTo tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. \n\nLuna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.\n\nAnd yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.\n\nShe would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.\n\nThe only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.\n\nAt that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.\n\nLuna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\nThe mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.\n\nLuna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.\n\nLuna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGood, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. \n\nFor the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. \n\nWhat neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.\n\nAs she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.\n\nAfter a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. \n\nLuna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.\n\nLuna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.\n\nLuna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCelestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. \n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.\n\nOnce Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.\n\nAfter a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.\n\nTrixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. \n\nLuna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. \n\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.\n\nTrixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.\n\nTrixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.\n\nLuna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBefore Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. \n\nTrixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\n\nLuna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. \n\nLuna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.\n\nAs she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. \n\nYelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.\n\nLuna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. \n\nAnother moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.\n\nEager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.\n\nStopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.\n\nThe two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.\n\nLuna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.\n\nSeemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.\n \nCelestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her\n.\nLuna hit her head on the closest wall.\n\n***\n\nThis was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\nTrixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.\n\nTrixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. \n\nLuna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. \n\nLuna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.\n\nAs Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.\n\nTrixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.\n\nLuna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. \n\nLuna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.\n\nLuna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.\n\nThe alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.\n\nLuna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.\n\nLuna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. \n\nThe blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.\n\nThe mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. \n\nLuna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.\n\nFrom behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn to face her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a voice that contained no sorrow whatsoever. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes things happen. She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna let her head hit the floor.\n', 1, 11, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/10/accolade">Accolade</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Cereal+Velocity">Cereal Velocity</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Accolade</h3>\n<p><i>Your heart is my pi\xc3\xb1ata.</p><p><b>Chuck Palahniuk</b></p><p></i>\t\t</p><p>Asking for help was not something the Great and Powerful Trixie was used to doing. Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.</p><p class="double">It had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.</p><p class="double">And, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. </p><p class="double">At first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.</p><p class="double">It was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. </p><p class="double">Everypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.</p><p class="double">Getting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.</p><p class="double">Taking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?</p><p class="double">And it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.</p><p class="double">To tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. </p><p class="double">Luna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.</p><p class="double">And yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.</p><p class="double">She would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.</p><p class="double">The only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.</p><p class="double">At that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.</p><p class="double">Luna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p><p class="double">The mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.</p><p class="double"> \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.</p><p class="double">Luna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.</p><p class="double">Luna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Good, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. </p><p class="double">For the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. </p><p class="double">What neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">It was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.</p><p class="double">As she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. </p><p class="double">Luna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.</p><p class="double">The two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.</p><p class="double">Luna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.</p><p class="double">Luna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Celestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Under any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. </p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.</p><p class="double">Once Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.</p><p class="double">After a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. </p><p class="double">Luna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. </p><p class="double">She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.</p><p class="double">Trixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.</p><p class="double">Trixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.</p><p class="double">Luna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Before Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. </p><p class="double">Trixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.</p><p class="double">Luna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. </p><p class="double">Luna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.</p><p class="double">As she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. </p><p class="double">Yelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.</p><p class="double">Luna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. </p><p class="double">Another moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.</p><p class="double">Eager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.</p><p class="double">Stopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.</p><p class="double">The two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.</p><p class="double">Luna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">***</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Luna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.</p><p class="double">Seemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her</p><p>.</p><p>Luna hit her head on the closest wall.</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">This was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.</p><p class="double">Trixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.</p><p class="double">Trixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. </p><p class="double">Luna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. </p><p class="double">Luna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.</p><p class="double">As Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.</p><p class="double">Trixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.</p><p class="double">Luna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. </p><p class="double">Luna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.</p><p class="double">Luna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.</p><p class="double">The alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.</p><p class="double">Luna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.</p><p class="double">Luna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. </p><p class="double">The blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.</p><p class="double">The mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. </p><p class="double">Luna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.</p><p class="double">From behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn to face her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a voice that contained no sorrow whatsoever. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes things happen. She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Luna let her head hit the floor.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 10], 'parent_story_id': 10, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// Accolade// Story: Accolade// by Cereal Velocity//------------------------------//\n\nYour heart is my pi\xc3\xb1ata.\nChuck Palahniuk\n\t\t\nAsking for help was not something the Great and Powerful Trixie was used to doing. Well, that and brushing her mane in the morning. It was always in perfect condition, of course, but nopony believed her when she tried to tell them that.\n\nIt had been fun cavorting around Equestria for a few months, surely. She had had her fair share of fun, her fair share of adventure, and her fair share of pretty fillies claiming that they had never been so attracted to another mare in their life. She had performed for all manner of audiences; large and small, crowds of few and throngs of many. She had entertained entire cities and crowded bars, swarming parks and huge stadiums. She had done her dazzling magic for every type, from the most humble earth pony to powerful government officials and the greatest unicorn magicians- though, clearly, they were not as great as herself. She had truly seen it all in the eventful months since her failed show at Ponyville.\n\nAnd, yet, during her travels, something always nagged her from the back of her mind. Something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, no matter how many other mares she slept with or tricks she performed. It was something that she had never experienced in her life, and thought she never would. The problem was purple, had a star for a cutie mark, and had simply delicious lavender eyes.\n\nTrixie blinked at the stray thought. They were most certainly not delicious. How ridiculous.\n\nNevertheless, her encounter with Twilight had most definitely irked her. In her one, rare moment of weakness, she had been shown up. Unthinkable. \n\nAt first, she had been depressed about the whole affair. After that, she had tried to ignore it. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, she tried to distract herself with her performances. She put on the most impressive shows she had ever come up with since she had become a performer- shows that would have impressed the god queen rulers of Equestria themselves- and yet despite her brilliance, there still remained that nagging doubt that refused to leave her alone. She had even, after a few too many drinks one particular night, though about having a child with the preposterously pretty pony. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure where that idea had come from, nor if it was even physically possible.\n\nIt was her insatiable desire to rid herself of this nuisance that had led Trixie to the very doors of the Canterlot Royal Castle. \n\nEverypony had heard about Nightmare Moon\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hooves of Twilight and the five ponies in her company. Trixie had been surprised that none of them had drawn the obvious conclusion about the encounter- that perhaps Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so thrilled to have been brought down so easily. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, but it was all she had to go on.\n\nGetting past the perimeter guards to her castle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, nor had the trip up to Canterlot been trivial, but she knew that there was at least one pony that could help her, and that she lay inside these walls. She was her only hope- and Trixie hoped she could convince her to help.\n\nTaking a deep, dramatic breath, she knocked on the massive doors with a hoof.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna tossed aside another crumpled piece of parchment into the growing pile next to her. Who would have thought getting revenge on your enemies could be so much work?\n\nAnd it was, of course, revenge that she wanted. Strangely, it had not occurred to her to begin planning such a thing during her imprisonment on the moon. It was only after she had returned to Equestria that she had begun to consider such things, and it was turning out to be far more difficult than she had anticipated. Perhaps, she thought, looking past her mountain of ill-formed plans at the moon outside, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent all that time dancing.\n\nTo tell the truth, the whole Nightmare Moon thing had been a last-minute effort. It had almost worked, too, except for that insufferable purple unicorn and her little gaggle ruining everything with their magic tricks. Just thinking about her made Luna\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil. That whole escapade had just been embarrassing. Only her quick thinking and fake tears when her sister had shown up had salvaged the situation and made her look like a victim instead of a laughingstock. \n\nLuna looked at the paper in front of her, entitled The Celestia-pult. She lidded her eyes. This was hopeless. Maybe it was time to turn her attention to getting rid of Celestia\xe2\x80\x99s prized student instead of her- go for a psychological blow instead of a physical one. Surely that would make things easier.\n\nAnd yet, still, nothing came to mind. For all Luna\xe2\x80\x99s taunting and all her posturing during her attempted takeover, the small unicorn she had fell to was indeed very powerful- and she had been tutored by her sister, no less. Even taking that into account, if it were discovered that Luna had been the one responsible for the unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be banished to the moon this time. At the very least, she would end up with egg on her face again, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford that. Not again.\n\nShe would clearly need help to pull this off. The trouble was there was no one she could trust. A thousand years away from home tends to leave ones former acquaintances quite dead. That meant she would have to get social and buddy-buddy with somepony, and that was something she loathed to do- but she knew it would be a necessary chore. At the very least, they could end up slightly useful and absorb some magic before it hit her.\n\nThe only problem was who to choose to embark with her on this epic adventure.\n\nAt that moment, there came a small knock at the front door to her throne room.\n\nLuna looked up at the guards in front of the massive slabs of wood, nodding to them to indicate they should let whoever had knocked through. The guards silently complied, pulling the doors open. Standing in the moonlight of the garden outside was a small blue mare, wearing a purple cloak and hat studded with colorful star and moon patterns. Without waiting to be invited in, the mare entered the throne room with a purpose to her stride. The guards looked on at her warily, but did not stop her. As the stranger approached Luna, the god queen could see a fire and a drive in her eyes. The mare did not bow or prostrate herself before her when she was close enough, as Luna was used to. These things alone made Luna very interested in what she had to say before she had even begun to speak. And speak she did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare said loudly, her voice echoing in the nearly empty throne room. \xe2\x80\x9cI require your assistance and partnership in ridding Equestria of a thorn in her side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna had an inkling as to the mare\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but her response was almost automatic. She lifted her head regally. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not ask for a princesses\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in such a manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of- do you even know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna did her best to sound annoyed, though in truth she was delightfully amused at her frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will address me properly, or I will have the guards escort you away.\xe2\x80\x9d The pegasus guards moved a step closer to the stranger at Luna\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\nThe mare continued unperturbed in the same confident voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be unwise, your majesty. I seek to help bring you the sweet taste of victory you have sought for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. Could it be? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you speak of? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe blue mare donned a wide, manic grin, as if she had been waiting for that question. Her purple eyes glistened in the moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Great and Powerful Trixie, and I want what you want- revenge on Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna smiled the tiniest of smiles. Her prayers had been answered.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two unicorns retreated into the nearby library. Luna instructed all of the guards that had followed them to vacate the area, lest her sister become suspicious about a set of guards guarding a supposedly empty room. With the doors to the massive hall closed and securely locked, Luna could finally breathe easy. Her plan was going to come to fruition at last. She had feigned ignorance before, but she had recognized the small blue mare immediately. It was difficult not to hear of her escapades throughout Equestria, and she had been impressed more than once by a recounted tale of her performances. She had also heard of her show in Ponyville- and why this magician shared her hatred for Twilight. She glanced at the mare, who was poking around the books. She could not have found a more perfect partner to help her enact her revenge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an impressive collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said to her from across the room. Her voice once again echoed in the empty chamber. Luna took one last look around to make sure they were alone, and then approached the small unicorn.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you needed my help. So, start asking,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shifted from side to side, as if she were embarrassed about something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep this a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller mare whispered.\n\nLuna brought a hoof to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cCross my heart, hope to f-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she trailed off for a moment, her face scrunching in disgust, seemingly at her own words. She swallowed and continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that stupid unicorn is more\xe2\x80\xa6 technically proficient at magic than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely at her pained admission. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. She is the personal prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of my sister, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that word means, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about any hot-for-teacher stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, giving Luna an odd look. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is her connection to your sister makes her very powerful. More powerful than myself. And it irks me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie turned to look back at the shelves of books. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked, still facing the books. \xe2\x80\x9cCold?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna narrowed her eyes at the mare\xe2\x80\x99s back. \xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said, levitating out a large book from the stacks and turning back around to face Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach you what, exactly?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie turned the cover of the book so it faced Luna. The gold embossed title read Really Advanced Magic: Part I of XXIV. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach me everything I need to know to get rid of Twilight Sparkle, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all you need? Magic lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie cringed as if in pain from Luna\xe2\x80\x99s wording. \xe2\x80\x9cRight. You teach me everything she knows, and a little more, and I remove a pesky problem from your life. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna pondered this idea for a moment. It did sound like a pretty good deal. She decided to make sure Trixie had the same plan she did, though, just in case. She started with an obvious question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, if I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching you, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop me from just going and taking care of her myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie just laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Great and Powerful Princess Luna strolling casually down the streets of Ponyville. That\xe2\x80\x99s real subtle. There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no chance that\xe2\x80\x99ll backfire. Might as well stop by the sweets shop while you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, and pick up a case of you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid and so is that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d She finished the last part of her sentence with a completely deadpan expression.\n\nLuna furrowed her brow and pretended to look offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly low-key yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have both a horn and the wingspan of a dragon,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unless you plan to kill her in her sleep- which isn\xe2\x80\x99t very sporting, if we\xe2\x80\x99re both honest- everypony will know it was you who killed the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 prized student.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna completed the conversational thread with the obvious bullet point. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would not bode well for my life expectancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie gave the princess a practiced, showboating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDuh. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s got four hooves and can solve that problem for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGood, Luna thought. Trixie was on the same page she was- and even better, she thought she had come up with the idea entirely on her own. Her heart was racing with excitement. This had literally dropped into her lap, and it just might actually work. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly screw this up. Once Twilight was out of the way, she could focus on her real goal: Celestia. \n\nFor the rest of the night, Luna shared a few choice things with the smaller mare, planning out Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping arrangements at the castle and her schedule of lessons over the next few days. When the sun was due to peak over the horizon, Luna led Trixie off to an unused room for her to get some sleep. \n\nWhat neither Trixie nor Luna had noticed was a white-furred alicorn, watching from one of the library balconies.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt was breakfast as usual in the royal castle. Fine dishes from all over Equestria were on the menu, dressed up with the most ornate of place settings and fine china. Steaming piles of bacon and freshly-baked bread covered the table, all freshly prepared that morning. Luna honestly just preferred toast.\n\nAs she arrived in the dining hall, Celestia was at the table already, cutting up a poached egg with a knife. As Luna sat down next to her sister, levitating her own knife to butter her simple breakfast fare, she discretely looked in the direction of her sibling. Celestia had the tiniest of smiles on her face as she chewed her food. Luna\xe2\x80\x99s fear got to her- she was instantly a little worried. Had she discovered anything? Luna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the one to give anything away, though. She looked in the opposite direction and took a bite out of her toast, ignoring her sister.\n\nAfter a minute or so of silence, though, her resolve broke down, and she looked back. Celestia had stopped eating and was watching her little sister with the same tiny smile. \n\nLuna frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe two sisters simply stared at each other, each daring the other to speak- Luna with a glare, and Celestia with her maddening smile. The only noise in the dining hall was the chirping of birds in the garden outside. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a menacing silence than a continuation of the rivalry that any two immortal siblings would have, if one were secretly trying to dethrone the other. As it turns out, Celestia spoke first.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.\n\nLuna nearly choked. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend; she\xe2\x80\x99s simply adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia elaborated, letting her mischievous grin spread a little further.\n\nLuna was thoroughly confused. Was her sister playing a game with her? Did she actually know anything? Had she heard what happened last night? She swallowed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCelestia propped her head up with a hoof, putting her elbow on the table, smiling all the while. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so shy about it, Luna- I approve. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s jaw dropped slightly. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\xe2\x80\xa6 and yet, she looked completely serious. Luna was silent for several seconds, trying to process this. Celestia took it as her cue to continue, her voice taking on that familiar motherly tone that Luna hated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuna, you\xe2\x80\x99re my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she started, reaching across the table to ruffle her mane. Luna sat completely still, her face still a mask of disbelief. Celestia kept going. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to be happy- you know that, right? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hide anything from me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the path that you want to take, I fully support you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder any other circumstances, Luna would have been on the floor with hysterics. Now, though, she was at a complete loss for words. Celestia kept her genuine, happy smile as she waited for her sister to say something. \n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s response was to quietly stand up, push in her chair, and walk out of the dining room to her quarters.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna spent the day asleep, as usual. When she awoke, she avoided her sister at the dining hall for dinner, instead requesting that her food be sent up to her quarters. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat of that awkward conversation.\n\nOnce Celestia had retired to her own room, Luna emerged, delving deep into the castle corridors to gather Trixie from her room, grabbing a tray of pastries from the kitchen on her way over. When Luna reached the unmarked door, she knocked quietly with her hoof. There was a sudden rustling from inside and a smattering of muffled swearing. Luna felt a little guilty- she hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted anything embarrassing. After a minute, Trixie mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9center!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna opened the door. Trixie was sitting up on the bed, the covers mostly over her, her face slightly flushed. Luna took a cursory glance around the room, but only found one alteration: a poster of one of the Wonderbolts on the wall. The name \xe2\x80\x98Spitfire\xe2\x80\x99 was written under the uniformed mare. Luna looked back at Trixie with a blank look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get that?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie shifted her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. She looked at the pastries. \xe2\x80\x9cAre those raspberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, changing the subject. Luna nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great and Powerful Trixie loves raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost sheepishly, grabbing one of the puffs off the plate.\n\nAfter a quick snack for the both of them, Luna led Trixie through the complicated castle corridors towards the library. Her paranoia guided her around the longest way around that she could find, though she doubted Trixie noticed. Once they reached the doors, Luna once again dismissed the guards and led her accomplice inside, instructing her to secure the door behind them.\n\nTrixie turned around and was about to comply when Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met the sight she had been secretly dreading. Inside the library, on a far table, nestled between stacks of books and what looked like tiny pillows, was a large plate of sandwiches and a smattering of small chocolates. On top of the platter was a tiny sign stuck into the top sandwich that clearly bore the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun, you two!\xe2\x80\x9d Underneath the words was a small red heart. \n\nLuna immediately turned around and started to walk out of the library. Trixie stared after her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie asked in a loud whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied in a flat voice.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe two ended up practicing in Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed room that night. Three productive nights passed there without incident, but far from comforting Luna, this only served to fuel her latent paranoia. She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what Celestia knew- if she were actually concerned about whatever she was concerned about, or if she were merely toying with her while she warmed up the straight-to-the-moon spell. Or both. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to tell the difference a thousand years ago and she sure hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any better at it in the meantime. \n\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop her, though. There was work to be done.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you know how to summon simple objects pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, beginning their third lesson for that night.\n\nTrixie, as if to prove a point, lit her horn and procured a perfectly smooth glass sphere into the air between them. It fell to the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered how to materialize more complex objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna continued, prompting her this time.\n\nTrixie shut her eyes, her horn glowed once again, and after a few seconds, a brilliantly detailed gemstone came into existence. The light from her horn and the candles around them shined through the facets of the jewel, covering the room with radiance. Trixie opened her eyes and grinned devilishly.\n\nLuna let a tiny smile cross her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAll very good. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d Using her own magic, she brought forth from the air a simple box. She levitated it in front of Trixie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to teleport out the item in this box.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna cocked an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must one do to teleport an object?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie thought for a moment, and then her face fell, her grin disappearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know what the object is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna nodded sagely. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrixie frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this supposed to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what skill might come in handy during a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said off-handedly. Trixie looked like she was about to say something in response, but gave up, shutting her eyes and focusing her magic. Luna placed the box on the floor, watching Trixie with anticipation. This spell was tricky, but not overly complicated. The object she had put in the box wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to manipulate either, but the mare would need to master this spell before\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBefore Luna could finish that thought, there appeared with a flash of light a book between the two unicorns- a book far larger than would have fit in the box. Trixie opened her eyes in confusion at the same time Luna read the title. It was Colts and Fillies, a book infamous for its\xe2\x80\xa6 racy content. It was often colloquially called, along with other reading materials like it, clop fiction. \n\nTrixie blinked in confusion and her jaw hung open. \xe2\x80\x9cUh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\n\nLuna simply turned and silently beat her head against the wall beside her.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe night of practicing was long and tedious, but fruitful. Trixie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to the powerful magic Luna was teaching her, but she was learning fast, which was exactly what Luna had been expecting. The two magicians stopped working around the time when Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn started to glow a weird color. \n\nLuna once again avoided Celestia at the breakfast table and had her food sent up to her room. When it arrived, though, it was the exact same plate of sandwiches and chocolates that she had seen in the library. Suddenly not hungry in the slightest, she frowned and pushed the plate away, crawling into bed. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. She vaguely remembered dreaming of the moon.\n\nAs she was accustomed to doing, she awoke at almost exactly dusk. She blinked a few times to get the sleep out of her eyes, and rolled over in her bed to get ready to raise Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s nocturnal satellite and her accompanying stars. To her surprise, she rolled over onto something warm and pony-shaped. \n\nYelping with surprise, Luna bolted upright and threw off the covers. Lying next to her in bed was a disrobed Trixie, who was looking back up at her with about as much surprise on her face as Luna felt. Neither said anything for a heartbeat, both of their jaws quite agape.\n\nLuna recovered first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my bed?!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in my-\xe2\x80\x9c Trixie started, but stopped suddenly when she looked around the room and realized that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her assigned quarters. Both ponies looked at each other again with a disbelieving silence. Trixie was blushing a deep red now that she realized what was going on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here on your own?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\nTrixie took another look around the room, then down at herself, then back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where are my robes? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite awake, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d she prodded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie repeated, quite forcefully. \n\nAnother moment of awkward silence. Trixie uncomfortably grabbed a hooffull of the sheets and covered herself up a bit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pretend this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, blinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie mumbled.\n\nEager to put the morning- technically evening- behind them, the two quickly left Luna\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Now that Luna knew that Celestia knew where Trixie had been living in the castle, she made a mental note to find her a new room. In the meantime, though, they two would need a new practice space, and Luna thought she knew just the place. There was a balcony loft that she knew for a fact was unoccupied. It was a special room, usually reserved for when Celestia wanted to address her subjects in the most public manner possible, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t often nowadays. Before Luna had been banished, she remembered it seeing frequent use. Times had indeed changed.\n\nStopping only to gather their spell books, the two made their way up the winding flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, Luna opened the door to find the room exactly the way she had remembered it. Nice, quiet, and private.\n\nThe two unicorns got settled, as they were now used to doing. Luna levitated one of the books and flipped to a dog-eared page. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, we left off on barrier spells\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie interrupted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome again?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ridiculous unicorn,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie clarified. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna looked at the mare thoughtfully. At one point she might have hesitated in telling her this, but she had grown to trust her during her admittedly short visit. Plus, she was helping her- what harm could it do? \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is next. This kingdom will be mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds pretty vengeful,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie noted lightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the mare that\xe2\x80\x99s still focusing on one failed show,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna pointed out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays the princess who\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on something that happened a thousand years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie countered.\n\nLuna was about to respond in kind when she realized Trixie had a point. They were both after something rather shallow and vain, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? And yet neither of them had really stopped and considered the consequences of the actions they were about to take. Luna looked into the younger mare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with a fresh understanding that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected. Perhaps there was more they could both learn from the other.\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s deep thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Luna swore quietly and lightly hit her head on the wall beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d a sing-song voice came from the other side of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia, I swear to-\xe2\x80\x9c Luna said, but the door opened before she could finish. Celestia popped her head into the room with a huge smile on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt! Just wanted to see if I could get you girls anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still smiling broadly. Luna gave her her best glare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Luna mumbled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia responded. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk your friend if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said, more forcefully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcha studying?\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia asked, peeking her head around to look at the books.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelly!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna shouted, shoving her sister back through the doorway with her head. Once she was outside the doorframe, Luna shut and locked the door. She took a few deep breaths and then turned back to Trixie with a deadpan look on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint taken,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said quietly.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLuna, exhausted from the night\xe2\x80\x99s work, once again prepared to bed down for the duration of the day. She opened the large window that dominated one side of her quarters to let the fresh dawn air fill the room. She took a deep breath and savored it- the balcony loft had gotten quite stuffy after so many diligent hours. Trixie was absorbing her lessons almost as fast as she could think of them. They had perhaps one more night of studies before Luna felt the unicorn was ready to perform her mission. One more night, she thought, turning away from the window and approaching her bed. She could surely keep her sister out of the way for one more night.\n\nSeemingly in response to that thought, Luna heard a rustling behind her, on the other side of her room. It sounded almost as if somepony had come through her window. Luna sighed and closed her eyes as she felt a headache coming on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Celestia?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning around. Celestia was indeed perched on her open windowsill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be grumpy with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna asked, narrowing her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just looking out for my little sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said, climbing down from the windowsill. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that such a crime?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave Celestia her best glare, but said nothing. The white alicorn trotted cheerily to Luna\xe2\x80\x99s bed, flopping down on it with a soft flump. She looked back up at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about being a good host, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playing with the sheets with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, it was nice of you to give her her own room and all. Shows respect for her privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna continued her silent glare. Celestia continued, oblivious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could certainly have asked me to procure a better room, certainly- but I understand! You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this gently. Slowly. I can appreciate that. Give her the old razzle dazzle. It works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t- who knows with these performer types?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna thought she knew where her sister was going with this, but kept her glare up. Celestia took a tiny pause in her diatribe and levitated a sandwich from the tray that Luna had left untouched near her bedside. She took a bite and spoke around the food.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, dear, you might not want to leave her waiting too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s glare dropped to a flat expression. \xe2\x80\x9cCelly, we\xe2\x80\x99re not-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t give me that,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn countered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from me, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna resisted the urge to sigh. There was no way she was getting out of the conversation. She decided to take the easy way out. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously not,\xe2\x80\x9d the alicorn grumbled.\n \nCelestia gave her sister a beaming grin, her point made. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up off the bed and magically opening the door out of the bedroom. Just as she was about to leave, she turned and looked back at Luna. \xe2\x80\x9cBe gentle with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of temperamental,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slyly. With that, Celestia walked past the threshold, the door closing behind her\n.\nLuna hit her head on the closest wall.\n\n***\n\nThis was it- the final night. Luna had picked a room as far away from her previous choices as she possibly could, to hopefully throw Celestia off. Luna looked on expectantly at Trixie as she closed her eyes and tried to perform the last spell for the night. If the performer could do it, then she had learned all that Luna could teach her- all that she needed to know to kill Twilight. It had been over a week of nonstop practicing and drilling and planning, and it was all coming to fruition right before Luna\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\nTrixie started to take on a peculiar glow as she focused her magic. Her horn positively lit up the room, it was becoming so bright. The blue unicorn mumbled something under her breath that Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. Without warning, the mare disappeared in a flash of light. Luna smiled at the space that she had previously occupied, now covered in wisps of smoke. She- they- had done it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie shouted from where she had successfully teleported - the other side of the room, near the balcony window. Luna turned around to see Trixie on her hooves, looking around in awe at her achievement. With the moonlight highlighting her form against the blackened sky, Trixie almost looked the same as she had the night she had broken into the castle grounds- but much happier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus endeth the lesson for tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna said contentedly.\n\nTrixie stamped a hoof on the ground in approval and whinnied. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn straight! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that little unicorn can do to stop me now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna gave the blue mare a wide smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we need to discuss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xc2\xa0All that remained now was to fill Trixie in on the exact details of how she would carry out her assignment. Luna had been obscuring the details of this intentionally up until now, just in case, despite Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s protests. Now that their lessons were over\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat when Trixie moved away from the window. Past the balcony railing, she saw the unmistakable silhouette of a horned, winged figure with a long, flowing mane, just out of sight. Celestia was here, watching them. \n\nLuna tried to keep her face impassive, but inside she was panicking. Not now. Not now, when she was so close. Her mind raced. She needed to get her sister away from that window for ten minutes. Ten minutes was all she needed. She knew her sibling, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to chase her off again; she\xe2\x80\x99d just come back. Celestia needed to leave on her own. \n\nLuna swallowed, and her heart fell into her stomach. She knew exactly what her sister was waiting for the two of them to do. She looked at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s advancing form, hoping against hope that her hastily-constructed idea would be enough. Trixie was not going to like this. Here goes nothing.\n\nAs Trixie walked the final steps towards Luna, the elder mare indicated silently that she should sit, which she did. Once Trixie was close enough, Luna put her snout gently against the blue unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s ear and gently nuzzled it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelestia is in the window,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered softly.\n\nTrixie, taken aback by both the unexpected gesture and the news, almost pulled away from Luna, but the alicorn lightly grabbed her ear with her teeth to stop her. Trixie took only a second to absorb the news, and then pulled her head back, seemingly understanding the gravity of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie whispered back nervously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get her to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna replied softly. Trixie paused, unsure of what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cJust pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Spitfire for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna elaborated. To Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s credit, as corny as Luna\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement had seemed to her, the blue mare took the hint without much hesitation and relaxed her posture. Her face had taken on a slight shade of red.\n\nLuna faltered, though. She was so out of practice that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she could make this look convincing. Plus, Trixie was a mare. Luna would have to fake this like she\xe2\x80\x99d never faked before. Just take it slow, she encouraged herself. \n\nLuna continued her nuzzling motion under and around Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, massaging the side of her head with her snout. She alternated between rubbing that spot and kneading the underside of Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Every few moments she would nip a little at Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s ear, which, after a few rounds, began to elicit soft moans from the blue mare. To her surprise, Luna could feel Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s face getting redder and redder. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected that. She felt a little guilty for doing this to her, but she was sure the unicorn understood what was at stake. Though Luna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, her guilt was alleviated slightly by the sheer virtue of the fact that she was either apparently doing a decent job or that Trixie was a remarkably good faker.\n\nLuna stole a quick glance towards the window. She still saw the shadow of her sister watching them. It dawned on her that this would get awkward quickly if Celestia had no plans to leave, but Luna liked to think her sister had some sense of dignity. Time to continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered quietly, mostly as a forewarning. Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows shot up even as her eyes remained closed, as if she had been awoken from a trance. All Luna got in response was a soft hum and a nod from the blue mare.\n\nThe alicorn stopped her nuzzling and brought her lips experimentally to Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s. Their height difference made the movement a little awkward at first, which Luna solved by backing up a bit from her student. The heat coming from the performer\xe2\x80\x99s face was very apparent now. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sure what to expect Trixie to taste like, but Luna thought she tasted a tiny hint of blueberries. Trixie didn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate the kiss at first, but slowly, gradually began to push back on Luna\xe2\x80\x99s lips with her own. The princess had no idea if she was doing her part correctly, but Trixie seemed to be enjoying it just fine. Luna kept it up for the better part of a minute before Trixie offered her tongue. Luna was surprised by the gesture, but accepted it. Their makeout session intensified. After another minute, Luna broke the kiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked quietly, taking another glance at the window. Celestia was still there. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAuthenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie cooed, nuzzling Luna\xe2\x80\x99s neck as the alicorn had done previously.\n\nLuna resisted the urge to shrug. Her sister was being very persistent- it was probably time to look a little more serious about what they were doing. She looked down at her student. Her face was now bright red. She looked further up, and eyed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn warily. This she did have some experience in, but it had been so long since she had practiced it that, in this case, she was even more unsure of how to proceed. Here goes some more nothing.\n\nLuna gently brushed Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s horn with her snout, which caused the mare to tense her body slightly. Luna repeated the action a few times until Trixie seemed used to it, then gave the appendage a light lick. Trixie sighed with pleasure, and involuntarily ducked her head a little. Luna took that as her signal to proceed. She gave the shaft another lick, stronger this time. Trixie almost shivered. \xc2\xa0Luna looked up for just a moment to the window, and saw the sight she had been hoping for- the figure was turning away from the balcony! Just a few more seconds\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie said suddenly, forcefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s heart skipped a beat as the figure in the window paused, and turned back to the castle. No! Not now! I\xe2\x80\x99m so close! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luna hissed. \n\nThe blue mare had already stood up before Luna could stop her. Her eyes were focused oddly, her breathing was irregular, and she looked angry. Her blush had spread across her entire face. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrixie, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d Luna whispered loudly, hoping to salvage the situation, but already instinctively knew that her plan had just fallen through the floor. At the very last second. Amazing.\n\nThe mare narrowed her gaze dangerously, her tone absolutely furious as she unsuccessfully tried to wipe her horn clean with a hoof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning this all along! You and your sister have set this all up so you can get me into bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna\xe2\x80\x99s face dropped into utter disbelief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the Great and Powerful Trixie is stupid?!\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care about getting revenge on Twilight! You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about teaching me magic! All you wanted was Trixie\xe2\x80\x99s Great and Powerful bits!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna blinked in confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your mone-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Trixie started, but her face scrunched up with anger before she could finish. \xe2\x80\x9cInsulted!\xe2\x80\x9d she managed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake coming here!\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the blue magician turned away from Luna and lit her still-moist horn with magic. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect my things to be mailed by morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she screeched. With that, Trixie disappeared in the flash of magical light that Luna had just taught her, leaving small contrails of smoke where she had stood just a moment ago. \n\nLuna was left staring blankly at the spot, wondering how her until-then perfect plan had fallen apart in thirty seconds. She blinked. Yep, Trixie was gone. That had just happened. She was too surprised to be angry. She was too surprised to be upset. She was just confused.\n\nFrom behind her, Luna heard soft hoofbeats as Celestia approached. Luna didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn to face her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Luna,\xe2\x80\x9d Celestia said in a voice that contained no sorrow whatsoever. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes things happen. She really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your type, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuna let her head hit the floor.\n', 'epub': None}

He knew that Rainbow was going to be gone for a little while longer, so he figured that he had enough time to have a little fun for himself. Doing his best to keep his stiffening wings folded, he lowered the panties to the floor and stepped through the leg holes, then slowly pulled them up his hind legs.

"I\'m sure it\'s a perfect place for taking a little break from a busy life of a city as glamorous as Manehattan. Though, I frankly don\'t understand how a pony could get tired of it." She winked.\r\n\r\n\tCoco studied the cobble path underneath her hooves, her face graced with a faint smile. "Believe me, Miss Rarity, I needed this break more than you could imagine."\'\r\n\t\r\n"Why do you insist on calling me miss?" \r\nRarity pouted, her lip quivering.\r\n "Am I that much older than you?" \r\nA mirror produced out of thin air sailed in front of the unicorn\'s face. \r\n"Have wrinkles already appeared on my face? \r\nBecause every time you call me miss I have a \r\ndistinct feeling of another one popping right out." \r\nShe looked deep in Coco\'s eyes. \r\n"Do you want me to feel old?"\r\n\t\r\n\t"Of course not... Rarity," Coco chuckled.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe fashionista clapped her hooves. "Excellent! Now, be a dear and tell me what you think of the prototype line I showed you, hm?" She narrowed her eyes slightly. "But remember, I want to hear an honest opinion."\r\n\tefwefwefwef\r\n\twegfwefwegweg\r\n\r\nwgwegwegweg\r\n\r\n"Fit for a princess." Coco exhaled. "You couldn\'t have chosen a more fitting name. Where do you get those amazing fabrics and ideas from?"\r\n\r\nRarity smiled, her eyes brimming with pride. "Why, thank you. I do hope you won\'t hold my desire not to reveal my trade secrets against me."\r\n\r\nThe earth pony smiled. "Of course not. I understand it perfectly, especially considering the Polomare incident."\r\n\r\n"Speaking of my former competitor..." Rarity\'s brow furrowed marginally despite her best effort not to show it. "How is she faring in the big city?"\r\n\r\n"Frankly \xe2\x80\x93" Coco drew a sigh of relief "\xe2\x80\x93 I don\'t know. And have no desire to find out."\r\n\r\nThe corners of Rarity\'s lips traveled upwards by a degree most ponies wouldn\'t even notice. "A wise decision, if you don\'t mind me saying that. She worked very hard to deserve ponies\' ostracism. I wonder whether she is happy now that she\'s finally earned it."\r\n\r\nCoco didn\'t answer, nor did she drag the topic on any longer. Suri Polomare was, like any other unwanted bygone, best left alone.\r\n\r\n"You, on the other hoof, seem to be taking the city by storm." Rarity nudged the earth pony\'s side with a hoof, a sly smile forming on her face. The blush on Coco\'s face only encouraged her to go on with the teasing. "Oh, don\'t be so modest, darling. The word about your partnership with that lovely zebra potion master have already left Manehattan and traveled within the upper classes of Canterlot. Who would have thought it would be perfumes?"\r\n\r\nCoco studied the patterns of cobble beneath her hooves as her cheeks threatened to burn the coat off her skin. "Well, the mares of my family have been known for their keen sense of smell for generations," she said, "but before I met Zaree, I have never expected I could use mine to test the aroma of perfumes."\r\n\r\n"Just think of the possibilities." Rarity waved her hoof at the sky, her eyes glimmering. "In a few years from now, every mare in Canterlot, Baltimare, Manehattan, and Fillydelphia shall be wearing my dresses and freshen herself up with your perfumes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about every mare," Coco chuckled. She stopped and looked Rarity in the eyes. "But if they do, I will owe it all to you. If it weren\'t for you, Rarity, I would probably still be sewing buttons for Suri."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, darling." Rarity shook her head. "I gave you but the tiniest of pushes, everything else is your own merit."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, the tiniest of pushes moves that one small pebble which starts an avalanche, though." Coco smiled.\r\n\r\n"And what an avalanche it will be." Rarity\'s eyes glittered with tiny stars. "The Coco-Zaree perfumes will cause a stir, I\'m sure of it."\r\n\r\nThe earth pony rubbed the back of her head. "I don\'t think Zaree would want her name to appear on a perfume label. Zebras are very protective of their given name, you know. They consider sharing it a great honor, given only to those they trust and respect."\r\n\r\n"Imagine that, I had no idea." Rarity slowed down her trot, noticing Coco had stopped before the fountain. "Ponyville does have its own zebra herbal expert. She calls herself Zecora, but after what you\'ve told me, we have no way of knowing whether it\'s her real name."\r\n\r\nCoco scratched her chin. "It certainly sounds zebrish... But Zaree once mentioned zebra names are built of two parts, separated by an apostrophe. Most probably Miss Zecora only revealed half of her name to you, just like Zaree did to me."\r\n\r\n"Why would anypony\xe2\x80\x94or a zebra, for that matter\xe2\x80\x94do that?" Rarity stopped to look in Coco\'s eyes, her brow furrowed in shock and disbelief. "I would love to have my own name known and recognized. To think that somepony would intentionally hide it..."\r\n\r\n"Well, Zaree once told me full name is everything zebra shamans need to put a curse on someone. Perhaps that\'s the reason for their secrecy?" She shrugged. "I can\'t say I believe in any of that, but I\'m surely not going to challenge her beliefs."\r\n\r\n"Celestia forbid." Rarity shook her head. "This raises an interesting question, though. How do other ponies address her?"\r\n\r\n"When she introduces herself, she prefers to use the direct translation of her name in our language: Spirit Channel."\r\n\r\n"It does sound a tad more pony, I\'ll give her that." Rarity\'s face burst in a radiant smile as she turned to her friend. "Well then, I guess they will be Coco-Channel perfumes taking on Equestria then."\r\n\r\nCoco smiled to herself, containing a blush that crept on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nRarity motioned at the earth pony, leaning secretly towards her. "Before they do, however, I\'m positive you should think of appropriate names for them. Something that smells as divine as that little bottle you gave me, deserves a more fitting name than a simple \'No. 5\', wouldn\'t you agree?"\r\n\r\nCoco offered a sheepish smile.

Strobe lights were funny like that, and Rainbow Dash pondered whether that it was due \nto the fact that ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had strobes in the wild. However, at this point she decided that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care, as she was out at a club, and that there probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough alcohol in her bloodstream if she could think that coherently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow!

What\xe2\x80\x99s all that about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell, she had to think of something to say, and the \xe2\x80\x98lights thing\xe2\x80\x99 was already in her head\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhhh, on second thoughts, never mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn\xe2\x80\x99, Rainbow thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98Why\xe2\x80\x99d I mention the lights, It was a stupid idea. Moving swiftly on\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, can I get you a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99d be splendid, Rainbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99d help to know what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, do you mind if I tell you something?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHuh, she always has to beat around the bush, but if I told her that, she\xe2\x80\x99d probably just laugh at me for using such a clich\xc3\xa9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it what you want to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sort of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on then\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be surprised, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight goes off into an inaudible whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to speak up, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight moved towards Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear and whispered;\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never drunk before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRed spread across the purple pony\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks.\nRainbow stifled a laugh, but Twilight missed it, in her embarrassment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they have booze in Canterlot?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just get you what I\xe2\x80\x99m having, shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a small voice, Rainbow heard;\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99d be nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe back in ten seconds, flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow turned and clopped towards the bar. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99d been a bit mean on the poor filly, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but think that at somepony had to be a bit mean on the new pony. Well, maybe the not so new pony. Twilight had been living in Ponyville for quite some time now. Anyway, Rainbow had invited her out, so that was something.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour double Fillykicks please\xe2\x80\x9d She mumbled, nonchalantly.\nBest to get a couple of rounds in, she thought; saves coming back for more so quickly.\n\n***\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash, What in Equestria are you doing?!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust having a bit of fun, Twilight, lighten up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, okay, fine, just get off of the table!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight Sparkle was overwhelmed with the drunken version of Rainbow Dash, she \nwas even more of a loose cannon than she was normally.Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think that was possible.\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s ruining all order in the club!\xe2\x80\x99, Twilight thought; her obsessiveness rife within her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeez, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, stop being such a killjoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\nDespite the uncooperative speech, Rainbow still got off of the table, but she still insisted on flying down. And now she\xe2\x80\x99d started shortening her name to \xe2\x80\x98Twi\xe2\x80\x99. She\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to call her Twilight, not Twi\xe2\x80\x99, but Twilight had learnt not to argue with a drunk Rainbow Dash, as that was the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d ended up on the table in the first place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you wanna dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, but only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t draw attention to us like that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow ought to know perfectly what she meant, eyes were only just being averted from them now, and there were quite a lot of ponies they were sharing the table with, who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProbably best to move along, before we\xe2\x80\x99re hoofed with the bill for the ponies who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I love this song!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how Rainbow could tell the difference, the thumping bass just sounded the same as the previous song, but she supposed that maybe the alcohol within her own bloodstream was beginning to take its toll on her senses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I said\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two ponies were on a rather cramped dance floor, below the bar area, \ncrammed full of other rather drunk ponies, all doing some sort of \ndrunken dancing/stumbling about type affair.\n\nSuddenly, Rainbow fell forwards, jolted by a few over-enthusiastic colts, into Twilight, sending them both into a heap on the dance floor.\n\nAs her senses came back to her, she could only hear an incredibly irate Rainbow Dash, screaming at the top of her lungs.\nThe music had stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6F YOU HADN'T BEEN BEING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, WE\xe2\x80\x99D STILL ALL BE HAVING A\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c...NICE NIGHT OUT, BUT NO, YOU HAD TO\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried her best to be louder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6GO AND- Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re awake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could feel pain across her forehead, spattered with a sort of wet feeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, can you open your eyes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe tried to open her eyes.\nVision came through, dappled by red.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, say something, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pulled her head off of the floor, mostly ignoring the wetness, and looked up. There was a mostly red faced filly looking down at her, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out the face it\xe2\x80\x99s self.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe red filly waved a hoof at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right here, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, what? Rainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re all red.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, blood is red, ya\xe2\x80\x99 know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s sight had mostly come back to her by now, at least as far as she could tell, and Rainbow was right. Her face was largely red, caked in blood, with what looked like it was a rather deep gash on her forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Celestia, Rainbow Dash! What happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked pale, in-between the spatters of blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, but I think we need to get out of here. Can you stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight pushed against the sticky floor with her fore legs, trying to ignore the pain in her left leg, followed by her putting her hind legs firmly out.  \nShe\xe2\x80\x99d live; it was probably just a couple of large bruises, she thought. Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. \nThe two fillies stepped out into the cold.\n\nTwilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself. Maybe Rainbow just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go of her cool exterior, like Twilight herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but analyse everything that came before her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully pale\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was fine, Okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could tell that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s once powerful, confident stride had diminished into a stumbling, slow stagger, although it seemed as though she was trying to cover it up. Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you look terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow shot Twilight an evil look, but it looked pained, half-hearted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; you have a massive gash in your forehead, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a lot of blood, you\xe2\x80\x99re staggering along, you look like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the floor, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get at least some rest, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re still insisting that you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your definition of \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, she just let out a dissatisfied huff, and looked away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be a friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just pushing me away. Is that what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomething seemed to catch Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as she looked away from Twilight once more, instead gazing in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twilight, do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so she completely ignored me.\xe2\x80\x99 Twilight noted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow waved her hoof in the direction of Sugarcube Corner. Twilight could see a pink-tinged shadow, walking away from the cake parlour, slowly, subtly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I do believe it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight tried to sound un-interested, as she was still annoyed with Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of her worries; but it was intriguing, none the less. Where would Pinkie be going at this time of night?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, that Pinkie Pie can be so random, huh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but to be honest, Rainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still more worried about you than what Pinkie could be doing at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think because you changed the subject and started talking cocky again that I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Twi\xe2\x80\x99 just leave it, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was silence once more.\nTwilight actually still felt pity for the cocky pegasus pony, but not for the pain. She really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let down her \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 exterior.\nThey walked, in the dead stillness, and Twilight thought to herself that it was always quite funny when pathetic fallacy applied to the real world. Then she kicked herself once more for becoming to analytical of her own life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is me, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight and Rainbow were stood outside of the Library which acted as Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s surrogate home.\n\nShe looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still worried about you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked up into the sky, eyes darting away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sounded exasperated, but in a quite, morose tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll it take to shut you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was quiet for a second, as ideas formed in her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay the night here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked back down at Twilight, but stared at her, not making eye contact.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, sleep at my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know what you meant, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stared at Twilight obliviously.\nObviously not, Twilight thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not well, anypony can see that. If you stayed here, I could just\n keep an eye on you, in case you take a turn for the worse. I could get \nyou cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re covered in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash, please? Just for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t just tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight chuckled at her turn of phrase, but Rainbow obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the humour in it.\n\nShe ushered Rainbow inside, before she could change her mind.\n", 'chapter_number': 1, 'parent_chapter_id': 18, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Chapter 1</h3>\n<p><i>The party loving pink pony; Pinkie Pie, extinguished the last light within Sugarcube Corner, and with that, she was gone.</i></p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked up into the flashing strobe and immersed herself.

And now she\xe2\x80\x99d started shortening her name to \xe2\x80\x98Twi\xe2\x80\x99. She\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to call her Twilight, not Twi\xe2\x80\x99, but Twilight had learnt not to argue with a drunk Rainbow Dash, as that was the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d ended up on the table in the first place.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you wanna dance?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cFine, but only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t draw attention to us like that again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow ought to know perfectly what she meant, eyes were only just being averted from them now, and there were quite a lot of ponies they were sharing the table with, who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Probably best to move along, before we\xe2\x80\x99re hoofed with the bill for the ponies who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I love this song!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how Rainbow could tell the difference, the thumping bass just sounded the same as the previous song, but she supposed that maybe the alcohol within her own bloodstream was beginning to take its toll on her senses.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I said\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The two ponies were on a rather cramped dance floor, below the bar area, </p><p>crammed full of other rather drunk ponies, all doing some sort of </p><p>drunken dancing/stumbling about type affair.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Rainbow fell forwards, jolted by a few over-enthusiastic colts, into Twilight, sending them both into a heap on the dance floor.</p><p class="double">As her senses came back to her, she could only hear an incredibly irate Rainbow Dash, screaming at the top of her lungs.</p><p>The music had stopped.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6F YOU HADN&#039;T BEEN BEING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, WE\xe2\x80\x99D STILL ALL BE HAVING A\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c...NICE NIGHT OUT, BUT NO, YOU HAD TO\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried her best to be louder.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6GO AND- Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re awake!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could feel pain across her forehead, spattered with a sort of wet feeling.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, can you open your eyes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">She tried to open her eyes.</p><p>Vision came through, dappled by red.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, say something, please?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">She pulled her head off of the floor, mostly ignoring the wetness, and looked up. There was a mostly red faced filly looking down at her, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out the face it\xe2\x80\x99s self.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cUhhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The red filly waved a hoof at her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right here, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut, what?

Her face was largely red, caked in blood, with what looked like it was a rather deep gash on her forehead.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBy Celestia, Rainbow Dash! What happened?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow looked pale, in-between the spatters of blood.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLook; I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, but I think we need to get out of here. Can you stand?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight pushed against the sticky floor with her fore legs, trying to ignore the pain in her left leg, followed by her putting her hind legs firmly out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She\xe2\x80\x99d live; it was probably just a couple of large bruises, she thought. Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. </p><p>The two fillies stepped out into the cold.</p><p class="double">Twilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">For somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself. Maybe Rainbow just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go of her cool exterior, like Twilight herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but analyse everything that came before her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully pale\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was fine, Okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could tell that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p><p>Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s once powerful, confident stride had diminished into a stumbling, slow stagger, although it seemed as though she was trying to cover it up. Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you look terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow shot Twilight an evil look, but it looked pained, half-hearted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLook; you have a massive gash in your forehead, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a lot of blood, you\xe2\x80\x99re staggering along, you look like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the floor, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get at least some rest, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re still insisting that you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your definition of \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, she just let out a dissatisfied huff, and looked away from Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be a friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just pushing me away. Is that what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Something seemed to catch Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as she looked away from Twilight once more, instead gazing in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twilight, do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so she completely ignored me.\xe2\x80\x99 Twilight noted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow waved her hoof in the direction of Sugarcube Corner. Twilight could see a pink-tinged shadow, walking away from the cake parlour, slowly, subtly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I do believe it is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to sound un-interested, as she was still annoyed with Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of her worries; but it was intriguing, none the less. Where would Pinkie be going at this time of night?</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, that Pinkie Pie can be so random, huh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but to be honest, Rainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still more worried about you than what Pinkie could be doing at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think because you changed the subject and started talking cocky again that I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Twi\xe2\x80\x99 just leave it, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">There was silence once more.</p><p>Twilight actually still felt pity for the cocky pegasus pony, but not for the pain. She really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let down her \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 exterior.</p><p>They walked, in the dead stillness, and Twilight thought to herself that it was always quite funny when pathetic fallacy applied to the real world. Then she kicked herself once more for becoming to analytical of her own life.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is me, then.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight and Rainbow were stood outside of the Library which acted as Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s surrogate home.</p><p class="double">She looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still worried about you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow looked up into the sky, eyes darting away from Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, please?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">She sounded exasperated, but in a quite, morose tone.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll it take to shut you up?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight was quiet for a second, as ideas formed in her head.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cStay the night here?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow looked back down at Twilight, but stared at her, not making eye contact.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, sleep at my house.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know what you meant, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow stared at Twilight obliviously.</p><p>Obviously not, Twilight thought.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not well, anypony can see that.

She blinked, and the outline of the resident pony DJ was obvious, nevertheless, when she blinked again, DJ Pon-3 was gone. Strobe lights were funny like that, and Rainbow Dash pondered whether that it was due </p><p>to the fact that ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had strobes in the wild. However, at this point she decided that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care, as she was out at a club, and that there probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough alcohol in her bloodstream if she could think that coherently.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow!

Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. </p><p>The two fillies stepped out into the cold.</p><p class="double">Twilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">For somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself.

Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99.

She\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to call her Twilight, not Twi\xe2\x80\x99, but Twilight had learnt not to argue with a drunk Rainbow Dash, as that was the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d ended up on the table in the first place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you wanna dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, but only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t draw attention to us like that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow ought to know perfectly what she meant, eyes were only just being averted from them now, and there were quite a lot of ponies they were sharing the table with, who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProbably best to move along, before we\xe2\x80\x99re hoofed with the bill for the ponies who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I love this song!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how Rainbow could tell the difference, the thumping bass just sounded the same as the previous song, but she supposed that maybe the alcohol within her own bloodstream was beginning to take its toll on her senses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I said\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two ponies were on a rather cramped dance floor, below the bar area, \ncrammed full of other rather drunk ponies, all doing some sort of \ndrunken dancing/stumbling about type affair.\n\nSuddenly, Rainbow fell forwards, jolted by a few over-enthusiastic colts, into Twilight, sending them both into a heap on the dance floor.\n\nAs her senses came back to her, she could only hear an incredibly irate Rainbow Dash, screaming at the top of her lungs.\nThe music had stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6F YOU HADN'T BEEN BEING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, WE\xe2\x80\x99D STILL ALL BE HAVING A\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c...NICE NIGHT OUT, BUT NO, YOU HAD TO\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried her best to be louder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6GO AND- Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re awake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could feel pain across her forehead, spattered with a sort of wet feeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, can you open your eyes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe tried to open her eyes.\nVision came through, dappled by red.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, say something, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pulled her head off of the floor, mostly ignoring the wetness, and looked up. There was a mostly red faced filly looking down at her, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out the face it\xe2\x80\x99s self.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe red filly waved a hoof at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right here, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, what? Rainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re all red.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, blood is red, ya\xe2\x80\x99 know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s sight had mostly come back to her by now, at least as far as she could tell, and Rainbow was right. Her face was largely red, caked in blood, with what looked like it was a rather deep gash on her forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Celestia, Rainbow Dash! What happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked pale, in-between the spatters of blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, but I think we need to get out of here. Can you stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight pushed against the sticky floor with her fore legs, trying to ignore the pain in her left leg, followed by her putting her hind legs firmly out.  \nShe\xe2\x80\x99d live; it was probably just a couple of large bruises, she thought. Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. \nThe two fillies stepped out into the cold.\n\nTwilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself. Maybe Rainbow just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go of her cool exterior, like Twilight herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but analyse everything that came before her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully pale\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was fine, Okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could tell that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s once powerful, confident stride had diminished into a stumbling, slow stagger, although it seemed as though she was trying to cover it up. Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you look terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow shot Twilight an evil look, but it looked pained, half-hearted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; you have a massive gash in your forehead, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a lot of blood, you\xe2\x80\x99re staggering along, you look like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the floor, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get at least some rest, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re still insisting that you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your definition of \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, she just let out a dissatisfied huff, and looked away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be a friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just pushing me away. Is that what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomething seemed to catch Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as she looked away from Twilight once more, instead gazing in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twilight, do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so she completely ignored me.\xe2\x80\x99 Twilight noted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow waved her hoof in the direction of Sugarcube Corner. Twilight could see a pink-tinged shadow, walking away from the cake parlour, slowly, subtly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I do believe it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight tried to sound un-interested, as she was still annoyed with Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of her worries; but it was intriguing, none the less. Where would Pinkie be going at this time of night?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, that Pinkie Pie can be so random, huh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but to be honest, Rainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still more worried about you than what Pinkie could be doing at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think because you changed the subject and started talking cocky again that I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Twi\xe2\x80\x99 just leave it, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was silence once more.\nTwilight actually still felt pity for the cocky pegasus pony, but not for the pain. She really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let down her \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 exterior.\nThey walked, in the dead stillness, and Twilight thought to herself that it was always quite funny when pathetic fallacy applied to the real world. Then she kicked herself once more for becoming to analytical of her own life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is me, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight and Rainbow were stood outside of the Library which acted as Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s surrogate home.\n\nShe looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still worried about you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked up into the sky, eyes darting away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sounded exasperated, but in a quite, morose tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll it take to shut you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was quiet for a second, as ideas formed in her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay the night here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked back down at Twilight, but stared at her, not making eye contact.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, sleep at my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know what you meant, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stared at Twilight obliviously.\nObviously not, Twilight thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not well, anypony can see that. If you stayed here, I could just\n keep an eye on you, in case you take a turn for the worse. I could get \nyou cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re covered in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash, please? Just for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t just tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight chuckled at her turn of phrase, but Rainbow obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the humour in it.\n\nShe ushered Rainbow inside, before she could change her mind.\n", 1, 18, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'1\'></a><h3>Chapter 1</h3>\n<p><i>The party loving pink pony; Pinkie Pie, extinguished the last light within Sugarcube Corner, and with that, she was gone.</i></p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked up into the flashing strobe and immersed herself.

She\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to call her Twilight, not Twi\xe2\x80\x99, but Twilight had learnt not to argue with a drunk Rainbow Dash, as that was the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d ended up on the table in the first place.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you wanna dance?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cFine, but only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t draw attention to us like that again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow ought to know perfectly what she meant, eyes were only just being averted from them now, and there were quite a lot of ponies they were sharing the table with, who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Probably best to move along, before we\xe2\x80\x99re hoofed with the bill for the ponies who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I love this song!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how Rainbow could tell the difference, the thumping bass just sounded the same as the previous song, but she supposed that maybe the alcohol within her own bloodstream was beginning to take its toll on her senses.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I said\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The two ponies were on a rather cramped dance floor, below the bar area, </p><p>crammed full of other rather drunk ponies, all doing some sort of </p><p>drunken dancing/stumbling about type affair.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Rainbow fell forwards, jolted by a few over-enthusiastic colts, into Twilight, sending them both into a heap on the dance floor.</p><p class="double">As her senses came back to her, she could only hear an incredibly irate Rainbow Dash, screaming at the top of her lungs.</p><p>The music had stopped.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6F YOU HADN&#039;T BEEN BEING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, WE\xe2\x80\x99D STILL ALL BE HAVING A\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c...NICE NIGHT OUT, BUT NO, YOU HAD TO\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried her best to be louder.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6GO AND- Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re awake!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could feel pain across her forehead, spattered with a sort of wet feeling.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, can you open your eyes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">She tried to open her eyes.</p><p>Vision came through, dappled by red.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, say something, please?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">She pulled her head off of the floor, mostly ignoring the wetness, and looked up.

Can you stand?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight pushed against the sticky floor with her fore legs, trying to ignore the pain in her left leg, followed by her putting her hind legs firmly out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She\xe2\x80\x99d live; it was probably just a couple of large bruises, she thought. Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. </p><p>The two fillies stepped out into the cold.</p><p class="double">Twilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">For somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself. Maybe Rainbow just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go of her cool exterior, like Twilight herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but analyse everything that came before her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully pale\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was fine, Okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could tell that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p><p>Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s once powerful, confident stride had diminished into a stumbling, slow stagger, although it seemed as though she was trying to cover it up. Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99.

Is that what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Something seemed to catch Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as she looked away from Twilight once more, instead gazing in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twilight, do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so she completely ignored me.\xe2\x80\x99 Twilight noted.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow waved her hoof in the direction of Sugarcube Corner.

She blinked, and the outline of the resident pony DJ was obvious, nevertheless, when she blinked again, DJ Pon-3 was gone. Strobe lights were funny like that, and Rainbow Dash pondered whether that it was due \nto the fact that ponies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had strobes in the wild. However, at this point she decided that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care, as she was out at a club, and that there probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough alcohol in her bloodstream if she could think that coherently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow!

She\xe2\x80\x99d asked her to call her Twilight, not Twi\xe2\x80\x99, but Twilight had learnt not to argue with a drunk Rainbow Dash, as that was the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d ended up on the table in the first place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you wanna dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, but only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t draw attention to us like that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow ought to know perfectly what she meant, eyes were only just being averted from them now, and there were quite a lot of ponies they were sharing the table with, who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProbably best to move along, before we\xe2\x80\x99re hoofed with the bill for the ponies who\xe2\x80\x99d put drinks down on said table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I love this song!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how Rainbow could tell the difference, the thumping bass just sounded the same as the previous song, but she supposed that maybe the alcohol within her own bloodstream was beginning to take its toll on her senses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I said\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two ponies were on a rather cramped dance floor, below the bar area, \ncrammed full of other rather drunk ponies, all doing some sort of \ndrunken dancing/stumbling about type affair.\n\nSuddenly, Rainbow fell forwards, jolted by a few over-enthusiastic colts, into Twilight, sending them both into a heap on the dance floor.\n\nAs her senses came back to her, she could only hear an incredibly irate Rainbow Dash, screaming at the top of her lungs.\nThe music had stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6F YOU HADN'T BEEN BEING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS, WE\xe2\x80\x99D STILL ALL BE HAVING A\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c...NICE NIGHT OUT, BUT NO, YOU HAD TO\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight tried her best to be louder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6GO AND- Twi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re awake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could feel pain across her forehead, spattered with a sort of wet feeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, can you open your eyes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe tried to open her eyes.\nVision came through, dappled by red.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, say something, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pulled her head off of the floor, mostly ignoring the wetness, and looked up. There was a mostly red faced filly looking down at her, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out the face it\xe2\x80\x99s self.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe red filly waved a hoof at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right here, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, what? Rainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re all red.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, blood is red, ya\xe2\x80\x99 know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s sight had mostly come back to her by now, at least as far as she could tell, and Rainbow was right. Her face was largely red, caked in blood, with what looked like it was a rather deep gash on her forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Celestia, Rainbow Dash! What happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked pale, in-between the spatters of blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, but I think we need to get out of here. Can you stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight pushed against the sticky floor with her fore legs, trying to ignore the pain in her left leg, followed by her putting her hind legs firmly out.  \nShe\xe2\x80\x99d live; it was probably just a couple of large bruises, she thought. Twilight looked around; the two of them really had brought the club to a standstill. There were mostly concerned faces, looking towards them, but slightly backed off. Twilight put this down to how irately Rainbow had been shouting at everyone. She also noticed a couple still going at it, dancing like a couple of mental ponies; she chuckled, and wished she had not a care like they did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was impatiently beckoning her to the door, At least from the side, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all red. \nThe two fillies stepped out into the cold.\n\nTwilight could see her breath, during the silence after the club. Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything since, so she\xe2\x80\x99d merely entranced herself staring at the patterns and the swirls in the low light of the night. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help think about convection currents, and how water vapour condenses when cold. Twilight smiled bitterly to herself, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just enjoy things? She always had to over analyse everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re being awfully quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor somepony who was so concerned about her earlier on, Twilight was surprised that she was being so blunt when it came to concerns regarding herself. Maybe Rainbow just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go of her cool exterior, like Twilight herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but analyse everything that came before her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully pale\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was fine, Okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could tell that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s once powerful, confident stride had diminished into a stumbling, slow stagger, although it seemed as though she was trying to cover it up. Anyway, Twilight had a sneaking suspicion that Rainbow was quite hurt, as would be flying along side her, if she could. In fact, this was probably the furthest Twilight had seen Rainbow Dash walk, well, ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I hate to say it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look just \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you look terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow shot Twilight an evil look, but it looked pained, half-hearted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook; you have a massive gash in your forehead, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a lot of blood, you\xe2\x80\x99re staggering along, you look like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the floor, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get at least some rest, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re still insisting that you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your definition of \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, she just let out a dissatisfied huff, and looked away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be a friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just pushing me away. Is that what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomething seemed to catch Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as she looked away from Twilight once more, instead gazing in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey Twilight, do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so she completely ignored me.\xe2\x80\x99 Twilight noted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pinkie Pie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow waved her hoof in the direction of Sugarcube Corner. Twilight could see a pink-tinged shadow, walking away from the cake parlour, slowly, subtly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I do believe it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight tried to sound un-interested, as she was still annoyed with Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of her worries; but it was intriguing, none the less. Where would Pinkie be going at this time of night?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, that Pinkie Pie can be so random, huh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but to be honest, Rainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still more worried about you than what Pinkie could be doing at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think because you changed the subject and started talking cocky again that I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Twi\xe2\x80\x99 just leave it, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was silence once more.\nTwilight actually still felt pity for the cocky pegasus pony, but not for the pain. She really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let down her \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 exterior.\nThey walked, in the dead stillness, and Twilight thought to herself that it was always quite funny when pathetic fallacy applied to the real world. Then she kicked herself once more for becoming to analytical of her own life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is me, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight and Rainbow were stood outside of the Library which acted as Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s surrogate home.\n\nShe looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I\xe2\x80\x99m still worried about you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked up into the sky, eyes darting away from Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sounded exasperated, but in a quite, morose tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll it take to shut you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was quiet for a second, as ideas formed in her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay the night here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked back down at Twilight, but stared at her, not making eye contact.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, sleep at my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know what you meant, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stared at Twilight obliviously.\nObviously not, Twilight thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re not well, anypony can see that. If you stayed here, I could just\n keep an eye on you, in case you take a turn for the worse. I could get \nyou cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re covered in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash, please? Just for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow looked into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t just tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight chuckled at her turn of phrase, but Rainbow obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the humour in it.\n\nShe ushered Rainbow inside, before she could change her mind.\n", 'epub': None}

She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\nWell,\n Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t like spending much time in the library anyway, it seemed\n as though it was lacking in energy; lacking in life.\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s\n addition of light wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much better, either. Long shadows of cast \naside books littered the floor, making the library seem somewhat even \nmore surreal. At least the shadows weren\xe2\x80\x99t definite anymore; they \npetered out into grey, slowly morphing back into the warm, flickering \nyellows of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s candlelight. It was more like the clouds of her \nhome, which settled Rainbow, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the incessant \nflickering, it seemed far too uncertain, almost ethereal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, do you want to sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe jumped, retracting away from what had seemed to be a bellowing noise, against the ambience.\nTwilight may have noticed, but Rainbow tried her best to shrug it off, with a non-committal huff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, why not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n slumped down onto the sofa that Twilight was gesturing to, and shut out\n the confusing half-light of the library. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the strange \nshapes and shrouds faze her, she was supposed to be strong.\nNo, she was strong!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, could I get a glass of water?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Rainbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n turned around, rump facing Rainbow, wiggling as she slowly moved \ntowards the basin, just out of the main library area. Just before \nTwilight moved out of earshot, Rainbow heard her mumble to herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, and a please wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go amiss, Miss \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m too full of myself to be polite-\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n went on, but Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care much, at least she was getting what \nshe wanted; her body was crying out for hydration, and she knew Twilight\n was good enough natured to comply with her meagre demands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss\n Dash, here\xe2\x80\x99s the water that you so eagerly await!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\n a cusp above sarcastic. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought some painkillers as well, madam. \nThat gash upon one\xe2\x80\x99s forehead must be a touch painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n chose to ignore the mock-royal treatment, and knocked back the small \nwhite caplets, gulping them down, with most of the water Twilight had \nbrought for her. Even so, the clinical bitterness of the pills was \npersisting on her tongue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n looked into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and did her best to smile, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\n come through. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Twilight this, but she was putting all \nher effort into not letting the tears inside her well up from the gash \non her forehead pulsing pain. She brought her hoof up to the wound, and \nbrushed across it. Rainbow let out an audible gasp, her head was still \ntender.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a silly pony, Rainbow! Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s still going to hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was being far too chirpy for Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tired, pained head, and so she chose to remain quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, we ought to get you cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely caked in blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was true; she could feel its dryness clinging to her face, stiffening her mane, beginning to itch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run you a nice, warm bath! You just take it easy, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really in the mood to talk; she\xe2\x80\x99d rather be at home now, \nsleeping. Still, she was sure this was the only way to keep Twilight \nquiet, and it had worked; to an extent.\n\nTwilight\n Sparkle turned around once more, this time heading towards the \nbathroom. She was once again wiggling her rump, swishing her tail side \nto side, almost as if she was trying to entice Rainbow.\nShe\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it, but Rainbow was enjoying it. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant \nto look, but the flick of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tail had caught her eye, and then \nthat was it. She was thinking of Twilight in other ways.\n She was cute, Rainbow would give her that. It was the lilac colour; \nthat hue painted Twilight in intense innocence, yet upon a rump so fine,\n Rainbow was wondering how she\xe2\x80\x99d never seen through such an innocent \nveil.\n\nMaybe it was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s personality. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent so much time thinking that, well, Twilight was quite frankly boring. Yeah, she was a good friend, and not bad to be around, but books? Seriously?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\n not like Rainbow was a stranger to the occasional book, she\xe2\x80\x99d been to \nflight school, and there was no escaping the textbooks there. Of course,\n she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that when she\xe2\x80\x99d signed up, but that was beside the \npoint.\n\nIt was then that Rainbow realised what she was doing.\nShe was slumped upon a sofa, in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s library, fantasising about her, whilst staring at her rump.\n\nThinking of another filly like that?! Rainbow, have you gone mad?!\nShe\n checked her wings; they were up in the air too, along with her \nthoughts. Rainbow hated that about herself, the one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \ncontrol. To be so excited that her wings manifest a life of their own. \nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\nRainbow\n could feel her face burning up, but she decided it was probably just \ndue to the wound on her head; it definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with \nher\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\nBesides,\n if she was going to be with another filly, it would be with somepony \nelse. Somepony she\xe2\x80\x99d already shared her feelings with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like \nto think about it, though. That a pony like her; \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash; The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d would do such things\n with another filly. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.  However, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \nkeep the two fillies out of her head. Twilight Sparkle, who was \ncurrently running a bath for her, and Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s other, already \nestablished, albeit secret\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Friend.\xe2\x80\x99  \n\nJust\n thinking of the situation made Rainbow burn up, so much so that she \ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bare to name the other damn pony. If she\xe2\x80\x99d known that it \nwas going to turn out this way, well, she might have changed things. \nJust a bit, at least.\nRainbow Dash realised that her wings were up, yet again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn things!\xe2\x80\x9d She uttered.\n\nRainbow\n folded her wings away, and laid down upon her back. That ought to keep \nthem in control, she thought, as another wave of heat cascaded over her \nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t my wound just stop burning me up? It\xe2\x80\x99s just so\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nRainbow exhaled a long breath, wavering.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d\n beaten her self into a corner, and she knew it. So what if she was \nembarrassed? It was probably just the alcohol taking its toll on her, \nshe thought, although she knew that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Rainbow \nwavered yet again.\n\nSo there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control, Rainbow thought, to her annoyance. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it works.\nOf course, she still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell Twilight that.\n\nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\n\n\n***\n\n\nTwilight slowly swayed towards the bathroom, watching her hooves blur before her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, like- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many hooves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Twilight then realised what she\xe2\x80\x99d done; she\xe2\x80\x99d used \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 in a sentence, and twice at that!  \nShe trotted into the bathroom, still \xe2\x80\x98tutting\xe2\x80\x99 at her literary disregard; she was beginning to sound too common for her liking.\n\nTwilight\n cranked the faucet on the bath over to hot, and watched the water flow \nout of the old, chunky library pipes. At least it was functional, she \nthought to herself. Some of the newer designer bathroom suites had \nstupid twiddly, nonsensical handles on the faucets. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to put up with such gimmicks! Well, she was a busy pony, what with all the studying and all.\nTwilight winced, as she realised she\xe2\x80\x99d blatantly disregarded the English language again! That didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make sense!\n\nMaybe\n it was down to the alcoholic intoxication, she thought. She\xe2\x80\x99d \ndefinitely read books about it; there was a section in her copy of \n\xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 labelled \xe2\x80\x98Adult\xe2\x80\x99, which touched on Alcohol, amongst other \nthings, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of book she was thinking about. \nTwilight needed something more academic, really.\nAll of a sudden, the quote she was searching for surfaced within her brain:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first few beverages will\n affect judgement, reaction time and brain activity, regardless of a \nPony\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism, tolerance to alcohol or BMI. As alcohol consumption \nincreases, reactions will become even more sluggish and delays in physical and mental coordination will become far more pronounced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was pleased with herself; she\xe2\x80\x99d remembered the quote with such ease, \nalthough she was a bit disappointed that she\xe2\x80\x99d turned to \xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 \nbefore the acclaimed yet controversial thesis; \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol: The bane or \nfather of Equestria?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n sat down on the cold, tiled floor of the bathroom, and brought her hoof\n over her fringe. It felt matted, rough to the touch. It was odd, she \nthought, having another pony\xe2\x80\x99s blood upon one\xe2\x80\x99s self, especially that of\n Rainbow Dash. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why it was so odd for Rainbow in \nparticular; it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite right.\n\nMaybe it was because she was too cool to bleed?\nTwilight\n knew this was complete nonsense, the moment she thought it, but she \nentertained the thought, if only momentarily, just out of mild humour. \nAnyway, the cocky pony would probably insist that she was too cool for \nbleeding, regardless of the facts.\n\nCondensation\n began to form on the tiled floor. Twilight slid her hoof \nhalf-heartedly, causing a light, traced line to form across a few tiles.\n The line, however, was only definite for a couple of seconds, as \ncondensation began to incur upon the divide she\xe2\x80\x99d drawn.\nTwilight\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t like this lack of certainty; it was as if as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99d \ncreated the definite, perfect line, the boundaries were blurred. It was \nas if the condensation was disobeying her rules, trying to overwhelm the\n change, trying to remain the same.\n\nHowever,\n Twilight still felt a sense of victory over the constantly condensing \ntiles: Even if it covered up the lines she\xe2\x80\x99d created, there was still \npresence. If you looked, ever so closely, you could see that there was \nindeed a line there before;\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d merely just\xe2\x80\xa6 changed.\n\nTwilight thought back to the events of the evening, and realised that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know why\n Rainbow was bleeding so much. Well, she knew that it had some relevance\n to a collision between them, but nothing like a straight up collision \ncould have caused such a deep gash as the one Rainbow had acquired upon \nher head. To do something like that, somepony would have to use \nsomething sharp, something piercing.\n\nA\n wave of realisation overwhelmed Twilight, and she leapt to her feet, \nleaving wet hoofprints upon the floor, soon to be consumed by the \ncondensation. She staggered over to the sink, snagging a towel en route.\n However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sink Twilight was after, but the mirror above \nit.\n She slowly brought the towel up to the \nonce reflective mirror.  Shaking, Twilight slid the flannelly material \nacross the surface, and she was presented with a fleeting look at her \nown face.\nIt may well have only been distinct for a couple of seconds, but she saw it. Her horn was red.\nHowever, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sort of jolly red, not the kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with whimsical, happy things.\n\nNo.\n\nIt was a horrible red. A dark, accusatory crimson.\nEven\n though the outline was no longer visible, it was still there. Twilight \ncould see the marks on the mirror, from where the condensation hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \nquite healed over properly, and within that, she saw herself.\nShe was only a smudge, when viewed through the veil of the condensated mirror.\nShe was a Purple smudge; Indefinite.\nDashed with crimson.', 'chapter_number': 2, 'parent_chapter_id': 25, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'2\'></a><h3>Everything Goes My Way</h3>\n<p>The library seemed vast, shrouded in darkness.</p><p> The cavernous room was eerie, and the motley assortment of books formed</p><p> cold, unnatural shapes, juxtaposing the soft, gradual shapes of the </p><p>clouds Rainbow Dash was so used to coming home to.

Even so, the clinical bitterness of the pills was </p><p>persisting on her tongue.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> looked into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and did her best to smile, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t</p><p> come through. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Twilight this, but she was putting all </p><p>her effort into not letting the tears inside her well up from the gash </p><p>on her forehead pulsing pain. She brought her hoof up to the wound, and </p><p>brushed across it. Rainbow let out an audible gasp, her head was still </p><p>tender.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a silly pony, Rainbow! Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s still going to hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight was being far too chirpy for Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tired, pained head, and so she chose to remain quiet.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, we ought to get you cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely caked in blood!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>It was true; she could feel its dryness clinging to her face, stiffening her mane, beginning to itch.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run you a nice, warm bath! You just take it easy, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really in the mood to talk; she\xe2\x80\x99d rather be at home now, </p><p>sleeping. Still, she was sure this was the only way to keep Twilight </p><p>quiet, and it had worked; to an extent.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> Sparkle turned around once more, this time heading towards the </p><p>bathroom. She was once again wiggling her rump, swishing her tail side </p><p>to side, almost as if she was trying to entice Rainbow.</p><p>She</p><p> didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it, but Rainbow was enjoying it. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant </p><p>to look, but the flick of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tail had caught her eye, and then </p><p>that was it. She was thinking of Twilight in other ways.</p><p> She was cute, Rainbow would give her that. It was the lilac colour; </p><p>that hue painted Twilight in intense innocence, yet upon a rump so fine,</p><p> Rainbow was wondering how she\xe2\x80\x99d never seen through such an innocent </p><p>veil.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s personality. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent so much time thinking that, well, Twilight was quite frankly boring. Yeah, she was a good friend, and not bad to be around, but books? Seriously?</p><p>It\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> not like Rainbow was a stranger to the occasional book, she\xe2\x80\x99d been to </p><p>flight school, and there was no escaping the textbooks there. Of course,</p><p> she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that when she\xe2\x80\x99d signed up, but that was beside the </p><p>point.</p><p class="double">It was then that Rainbow realised what she was doing.</p><p>She was slumped upon a sofa, in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s library, fantasising about her, whilst staring at her rump.</p><p class="double">Thinking of another filly like that?! Rainbow, have you gone mad?!</p><p>She</p><p> checked her wings; they were up in the air too, along with her </p><p>thoughts. Rainbow hated that about herself, the one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>control. To be so excited that her wings manifest a life of their own. </p><p>It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.</p><p>Rainbow</p><p> could feel her face burning up, but she decided it was probably just </p><p>due to the wound on her head; it definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with </p><p>her\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98feelings.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>Besides,</p><p> if she was going to be with another filly, it would be with somepony </p><p>else. Somepony she\xe2\x80\x99d already shared her feelings with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like </p><p>to think about it, though. That a pony like her; \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash; The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d would do such things</p><p> with another filly. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>keep the two fillies out of her head. Twilight Sparkle, who was </p><p>currently running a bath for her, and Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s other, already </p><p>established, albeit secret\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Friend.\xe2\x80\x99&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double">Just</p><p> thinking of the situation made Rainbow burn up, so much so that she </p><p>couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bare to name the other damn pony. If she\xe2\x80\x99d known that it </p><p>was going to turn out this way, well, she might have changed things. </p><p>Just a bit, at least.</p><p>Rainbow Dash realised that her wings were up, yet again.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDamn things!\xe2\x80\x9d She uttered.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> folded her wings away, and laid down upon her back. That ought to keep </p><p>them in control, she thought, as another wave of heat cascaded over her </p><p>face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t my wound just stop burning me up? It\xe2\x80\x99s just so\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Rainbow exhaled a long breath, wavering.</p><p>She\xe2\x80\x99d</p><p> beaten her self into a corner, and she knew it. So what if she was </p><p>embarrassed? It was probably just the alcohol taking its toll on her, </p><p>she thought, although she knew that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Rainbow </p><p>wavered yet again.</p><p class="double">So there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control, Rainbow thought, to her annoyance. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it works.</p><p>Of course, she still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell Twilight that.</p><p class="double">It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.</p><p class="double"></p><p>***</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight slowly swayed towards the bathroom, watching her hooves blur before her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, like- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many hooves!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Then Twilight then realised what she\xe2\x80\x99d done; she\xe2\x80\x99d used \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 in a sentence, and twice at that!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She trotted into the bathroom, still \xe2\x80\x98tutting\xe2\x80\x99 at her literary disregard; she was beginning to sound too common for her liking.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> cranked the faucet on the bath over to hot, and watched the water flow </p><p>out of the old, chunky library pipes.

She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to put up with such gimmicks! Well, she was a busy pony, what with all the studying and all.</p><p>Twilight winced, as she realised she\xe2\x80\x99d blatantly disregarded the English language again! That didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make sense!</p><p class="double">Maybe</p><p> it was down to the alcoholic intoxication, she thought. She\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>definitely read books about it; there was a section in her copy of </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 labelled \xe2\x80\x98Adult\xe2\x80\x99, which touched on Alcohol, amongst other </p><p>things, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of book she was thinking about. </p><p>Twilight needed something more academic, really.</p><p>All of a sudden, the quote she was searching for surfaced within her brain:</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cThe first few beverages will</p><p> affect judgement, reaction time and brain activity, regardless of a </p><p>Pony\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism, tolerance to alcohol or BMI.

It felt matted, rough to the touch. It was odd, she </p><p>thought, having another pony\xe2\x80\x99s blood upon one\xe2\x80\x99s self, especially that of</p><p> Rainbow Dash. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why it was so odd for Rainbow in </p><p>particular; it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite right.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was because she was too cool to bleed?</p><p>Twilight</p><p> knew this was complete nonsense, the moment she thought it, but she </p><p>entertained the thought, if only momentarily, just out of mild humour. </p><p>Anyway, the cocky pony would probably insist that she was too cool for </p><p>bleeding, regardless of the facts.</p><p class="double">Condensation</p><p> began to form on the tiled floor. Twilight slid her hoof </p><p>half-heartedly, causing a light, traced line to form across a few tiles.</p><p> The line, however, was only definite for a couple of seconds, as </p><p>condensation began to incur upon the divide she\xe2\x80\x99d drawn.</p><p>Twilight</p><p> didn\xe2\x80\x99t like this lack of certainty; it was as if as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>created the definite, perfect line, the boundaries were blurred. It was </p><p>as if the condensation was disobeying her rules, trying to overwhelm the</p><p> change, trying to remain the same.</p><p class="double">However,</p><p> Twilight still felt a sense of victory over the constantly condensing </p><p>tiles: Even if it covered up the lines she\xe2\x80\x99d created, there was still </p><p>presence. If you looked, ever so closely, you could see that there was </p><p>indeed a line there before;</p><p>It\xe2\x80\x99d merely just\xe2\x80\xa6 changed.</p><p class="double">Twilight thought back to the events of the evening, and realised that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know why</p><p> Rainbow was bleeding so much. Well, she knew that it had some relevance</p><p> to a collision between them, but nothing like a straight up collision </p><p>could have caused such a deep gash as the one Rainbow had acquired upon </p><p>her head. To do something like that, somepony would have to use </p><p>something sharp, something piercing.</p><p class="double">A</p><p> wave of realisation overwhelmed Twilight, and she leapt to her feet, </p><p>leaving wet hoofprints upon the floor, soon to be consumed by the </p><p>condensation. She staggered over to the sink, snagging a towel en route.</p><p> However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sink Twilight was after, but the mirror above </p><p>it.</p><p> She slowly brought the towel up to the </p><p>once reflective mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking, Twilight slid the flannelly material </p><p>across the surface, and she was presented with a fleeting look at her </p><p>own face.</p><p>It may well have only been distinct for a couple of seconds, but she saw it. Her horn was red.</p><p>However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sort of jolly red, not the kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with whimsical, happy things.</p><p class="double">No.</p><p class="double">It was a horrible red. A dark, accusatory crimson.</p><p>Even</p><p> though the outline was no longer visible, it was still there. Twilight </p><p>could see the marks on the mirror, from where the condensation hadn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>quite healed over properly, and within that, she saw herself.</p><p>She was only a smudge, when viewed through the veil of the condensated mirror.</p><p>She was a Purple smudge; Indefinite.</p><p>Dashed with crimson.</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// Everything Goes My Way// Story: With a Heavy Heart// by Krypqe//------------------------------//\n\nThe library seemed vast, shrouded in darkness.\n The cavernous room was eerie, and the motley assortment of books formed\n cold, unnatural shapes, juxtaposing the soft, gradual shapes of the \nclouds Rainbow Dash was so used to coming home to.

She\xe2\x80\x99d \ndefinitely read books about it; there was a section in her copy of \n\xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 labelled \xe2\x80\x98Adult\xe2\x80\x99, which touched on Alcohol, amongst other \nthings, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of book she was thinking about. \nTwilight needed something more academic, really.\nAll of a sudden, the quote she was searching for surfaced within her brain:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first few beverages will\n affect judgement, reaction time and brain activity, regardless of a \nPony\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism, tolerance to alcohol or BMI. As alcohol consumption \nincreases, reactions will become even more sluggish and delays in physical and mental coordination will become far more pronounced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was pleased with herself; she\xe2\x80\x99d remembered the quote with such ease, \nalthough she was a bit disappointed that she\xe2\x80\x99d turned to \xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 \nbefore the acclaimed yet controversial thesis; \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol: The bane or \nfather of Equestria?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n sat down on the cold, tiled floor of the bathroom, and brought her hoof\n over her fringe. It felt matted, rough to the touch. It was odd, she \nthought, having another pony\xe2\x80\x99s blood upon one\xe2\x80\x99s self, especially that of\n Rainbow Dash. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why it was so odd for Rainbow in \nparticular; it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite right.\n\nMaybe it was because she was too cool to bleed?\nTwilight\n knew this was complete nonsense, the moment she thought it, but she \nentertained the thought, if only momentarily, just out of mild humour. \nAnyway, the cocky pony would probably insist that she was too cool for \nbleeding, regardless of the facts.\n\nCondensation\n began to form on the tiled floor. Twilight slid her hoof \nhalf-heartedly, causing a light, traced line to form across a few tiles.\n The line, however, was only definite for a couple of seconds, as \ncondensation began to incur upon the divide she\xe2\x80\x99d drawn.\nTwilight\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t like this lack of certainty; it was as if as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99d \ncreated the definite, perfect line, the boundaries were blurred. It was \nas if the condensation was disobeying her rules, trying to overwhelm the\n change, trying to remain the same.\n\nHowever,\n Twilight still felt a sense of victory over the constantly condensing \ntiles: Even if it covered up the lines she\xe2\x80\x99d created, there was still \npresence. If you looked, ever so closely, you could see that there was \nindeed a line there before;\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d merely just\xe2\x80\xa6 changed.\n\nTwilight thought back to the events of the evening, and realised that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know why\n Rainbow was bleeding so much. Well, she knew that it had some relevance\n to a collision between them, but nothing like a straight up collision \ncould have caused such a deep gash as the one Rainbow had acquired upon \nher head. To do something like that, somepony would have to use \nsomething sharp, something piercing.\n\nA\n wave of realisation overwhelmed Twilight, and she leapt to her feet, \nleaving wet hoofprints upon the floor, soon to be consumed by the \ncondensation. She staggered over to the sink, snagging a towel en route.\n However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sink Twilight was after, but the mirror above \nit.\n She slowly brought the towel up to the \nonce reflective mirror.  Shaking, Twilight slid the flannelly material \nacross the surface, and she was presented with a fleeting look at her \nown face.\nIt may well have only been distinct for a couple of seconds, but she saw it. Her horn was red.\nHowever, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sort of jolly red, not the kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with whimsical, happy things.\n\nNo.\n\nIt was a horrible red. A dark, accusatory crimson.\nEven\n though the outline was no longer visible, it was still there. Twilight \ncould see the marks on the mirror, from where the condensation hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \nquite healed over properly, and within that, she saw herself.\nShe was only a smudge, when viewed through the veil of the condensated mirror.\nShe was a Purple smudge; Indefinite.\nDashed with crimson.', 2, 25, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'2\'></a><h3>Everything Goes My Way</h3>\n<p>The library seemed vast, shrouded in darkness.</p><p> The cavernous room was eerie, and the motley assortment of books formed</p><p> cold, unnatural shapes, juxtaposing the soft, gradual shapes of the </p><p>clouds Rainbow Dash was so used to coming home to.

She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Twilight this, but she was putting all </p><p>her effort into not letting the tears inside her well up from the gash </p><p>on her forehead pulsing pain. She brought her hoof up to the wound, and </p><p>brushed across it. Rainbow let out an audible gasp, her head was still </p><p>tender.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a silly pony, Rainbow! Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s still going to hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight was being far too chirpy for Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tired, pained head, and so she chose to remain quiet.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, we ought to get you cleaned up, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely caked in blood!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>It was true; she could feel its dryness clinging to her face, stiffening her mane, beginning to itch.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run you a nice, warm bath!

Still, she was sure this was the only way to keep Twilight </p><p>quiet, and it had worked; to an extent.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> Sparkle turned around once more, this time heading towards the </p><p>bathroom. She was once again wiggling her rump, swishing her tail side </p><p>to side, almost as if she was trying to entice Rainbow.</p><p>She</p><p> didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it, but Rainbow was enjoying it. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant </p><p>to look, but the flick of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tail had caught her eye, and then </p><p>that was it. She was thinking of Twilight in other ways.</p><p> She was cute, Rainbow would give her that. It was the lilac colour; </p><p>that hue painted Twilight in intense innocence, yet upon a rump so fine,</p><p> Rainbow was wondering how she\xe2\x80\x99d never seen through such an innocent </p><p>veil.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s personality. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent so much time thinking that, well, Twilight was quite frankly boring. Yeah, she was a good friend, and not bad to be around, but books? Seriously?</p><p>It\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> not like Rainbow was a stranger to the occasional book, she\xe2\x80\x99d been to </p><p>flight school, and there was no escaping the textbooks there. Of course,</p><p> she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that when she\xe2\x80\x99d signed up, but that was beside the </p><p>point.</p><p class="double">It was then that Rainbow realised what she was doing.</p><p>She was slumped upon a sofa, in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s library, fantasising about her, whilst staring at her rump.</p><p class="double">Thinking of another filly like that?! Rainbow, have you gone mad?!</p><p>She</p><p> checked her wings; they were up in the air too, along with her </p><p>thoughts. Rainbow hated that about herself, the one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>control. To be so excited that her wings manifest a life of their own. </p><p>It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.</p><p>Rainbow</p><p> could feel her face burning up, but she decided it was probably just </p><p>due to the wound on her head; it definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with </p><p>her\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98feelings.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>Besides,</p><p> if she was going to be with another filly, it would be with somepony </p><p>else. Somepony she\xe2\x80\x99d already shared her feelings with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like </p><p>to think about it, though. That a pony like her; \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash; The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d would do such things</p><p> with another filly. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>keep the two fillies out of her head. Twilight Sparkle, who was </p><p>currently running a bath for her, and Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s other, already </p><p>established, albeit secret\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Friend.\xe2\x80\x99&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double">Just</p><p> thinking of the situation made Rainbow burn up, so much so that she </p><p>couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bare to name the other damn pony. If she\xe2\x80\x99d known that it </p><p>was going to turn out this way, well, she might have changed things. </p><p>Just a bit, at least.</p><p>Rainbow Dash realised that her wings were up, yet again.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDamn things!\xe2\x80\x9d She uttered.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> folded her wings away, and laid down upon her back. That ought to keep </p><p>them in control, she thought, as another wave of heat cascaded over her </p><p>face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t my wound just stop burning me up? It\xe2\x80\x99s just so\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Rainbow exhaled a long breath, wavering.</p><p>She\xe2\x80\x99d</p><p> beaten her self into a corner, and she knew it. So what if she was </p><p>embarrassed? It was probably just the alcohol taking its toll on her, </p><p>she thought, although she knew that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Rainbow </p><p>wavered yet again.</p><p class="double">So there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control, Rainbow thought, to her annoyance. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it works.</p><p>Of course, she still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell Twilight that.</p><p class="double">It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.</p><p class="double"></p><p>***</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight slowly swayed towards the bathroom, watching her hooves blur before her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, like- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many hooves!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Then Twilight then realised what she\xe2\x80\x99d done; she\xe2\x80\x99d used \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 in a sentence, and twice at that!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She trotted into the bathroom, still \xe2\x80\x98tutting\xe2\x80\x99 at her literary disregard; she was beginning to sound too common for her liking.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> cranked the faucet on the bath over to hot, and watched the water flow </p><p>out of the old, chunky library pipes. At least it was functional, she </p><p>thought to herself. Some of the newer designer bathroom suites had </p><p>stupid twiddly, nonsensical handles on the faucets. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to put up with such gimmicks! Well, she was a busy pony, what with all the studying and all.</p><p>Twilight winced, as she realised she\xe2\x80\x99d blatantly disregarded the English language again!

You just take it easy, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Twi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really in the mood to talk; she\xe2\x80\x99d rather be at home now, \nsleeping. Still, she was sure this was the only way to keep Twilight \nquiet, and it had worked; to an extent.\n\nTwilight\n Sparkle turned around once more, this time heading towards the \nbathroom. She was once again wiggling her rump, swishing her tail side \nto side, almost as if she was trying to entice Rainbow.\nShe\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it, but Rainbow was enjoying it. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant \nto look, but the flick of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tail had caught her eye, and then \nthat was it. She was thinking of Twilight in other ways.\n She was cute, Rainbow would give her that. It was the lilac colour; \nthat hue painted Twilight in intense innocence, yet upon a rump so fine,\n Rainbow was wondering how she\xe2\x80\x99d never seen through such an innocent \nveil.\n\nMaybe it was Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s personality. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent so much time thinking that, well, Twilight was quite frankly boring. Yeah, she was a good friend, and not bad to be around, but books? Seriously?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\n not like Rainbow was a stranger to the occasional book, she\xe2\x80\x99d been to \nflight school, and there was no escaping the textbooks there. Of course,\n she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that when she\xe2\x80\x99d signed up, but that was beside the \npoint.\n\nIt was then that Rainbow realised what she was doing.\nShe was slumped upon a sofa, in Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s library, fantasising about her, whilst staring at her rump.\n\nThinking of another filly like that?! Rainbow, have you gone mad?!\nShe\n checked her wings; they were up in the air too, along with her \nthoughts. Rainbow hated that about herself, the one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \ncontrol. To be so excited that her wings manifest a life of their own. \nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\nRainbow\n could feel her face burning up, but she decided it was probably just \ndue to the wound on her head; it definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with \nher\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\nBesides,\n if she was going to be with another filly, it would be with somepony \nelse. Somepony she\xe2\x80\x99d already shared her feelings with. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like \nto think about it, though. That a pony like her; \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow Dash; The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\xe2\x80\x9d would do such things\n with another filly. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.  However, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \nkeep the two fillies out of her head. Twilight Sparkle, who was \ncurrently running a bath for her, and Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s other, already \nestablished, albeit secret\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Friend.\xe2\x80\x99  \n\nJust\n thinking of the situation made Rainbow burn up, so much so that she \ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bare to name the other damn pony. If she\xe2\x80\x99d known that it \nwas going to turn out this way, well, she might have changed things. \nJust a bit, at least.\nRainbow Dash realised that her wings were up, yet again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn things!\xe2\x80\x9d She uttered.\n\nRainbow\n folded her wings away, and laid down upon her back. That ought to keep \nthem in control, she thought, as another wave of heat cascaded over her \nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t my wound just stop burning me up? It\xe2\x80\x99s just so\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nRainbow exhaled a long breath, wavering.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d\n beaten her self into a corner, and she knew it. So what if she was \nembarrassed? It was probably just the alcohol taking its toll on her, \nshe thought, although she knew that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Rainbow \nwavered yet again.\n\nSo there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one thing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control, Rainbow thought, to her annoyance. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it works.\nOf course, she still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell Twilight that.\n\nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\n\n\n***\n\n\nTwilight slowly swayed towards the bathroom, watching her hooves blur before her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, like- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many hooves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Twilight then realised what she\xe2\x80\x99d done; she\xe2\x80\x99d used \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 in a sentence, and twice at that!  \nShe trotted into the bathroom, still \xe2\x80\x98tutting\xe2\x80\x99 at her literary disregard; she was beginning to sound too common for her liking.\n\nTwilight\n cranked the faucet on the bath over to hot, and watched the water flow \nout of the old, chunky library pipes. At least it was functional, she \nthought to herself. Some of the newer designer bathroom suites had \nstupid twiddly, nonsensical handles on the faucets. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to put up with such gimmicks! Well, she was a busy pony, what with all the studying and all.\nTwilight winced, as she realised she\xe2\x80\x99d blatantly disregarded the English language again! That didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make sense!\n\nMaybe\n it was down to the alcoholic intoxication, she thought. She\xe2\x80\x99d \ndefinitely read books about it; there was a section in her copy of \n\xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 labelled \xe2\x80\x98Adult\xe2\x80\x99, which touched on Alcohol, amongst other \nthings, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of book she was thinking about. \nTwilight needed something more academic, really.\nAll of a sudden, the quote she was searching for surfaced within her brain:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first few beverages will\n affect judgement, reaction time and brain activity, regardless of a \nPony\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism, tolerance to alcohol or BMI. As alcohol consumption \nincreases, reactions will become even more sluggish and delays in physical and mental coordination will become far more pronounced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was pleased with herself; she\xe2\x80\x99d remembered the quote with such ease, \nalthough she was a bit disappointed that she\xe2\x80\x99d turned to \xe2\x80\x98Slumber 101\xe2\x80\x99 \nbefore the acclaimed yet controversial thesis; \xe2\x80\x9cAlcohol: The bane or \nfather of Equestria?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n sat down on the cold, tiled floor of the bathroom, and brought her hoof\n over her fringe. It felt matted, rough to the touch. It was odd, she \nthought, having another pony\xe2\x80\x99s blood upon one\xe2\x80\x99s self, especially that of\n Rainbow Dash. Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why it was so odd for Rainbow in \nparticular; it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite right.\n\nMaybe it was because she was too cool to bleed?\nTwilight\n knew this was complete nonsense, the moment she thought it, but she \nentertained the thought, if only momentarily, just out of mild humour. \nAnyway, the cocky pony would probably insist that she was too cool for \nbleeding, regardless of the facts.\n\nCondensation\n began to form on the tiled floor. Twilight slid her hoof \nhalf-heartedly, causing a light, traced line to form across a few tiles.\n The line, however, was only definite for a couple of seconds, as \ncondensation began to incur upon the divide she\xe2\x80\x99d drawn.\nTwilight\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t like this lack of certainty; it was as if as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99d \ncreated the definite, perfect line, the boundaries were blurred. It was \nas if the condensation was disobeying her rules, trying to overwhelm the\n change, trying to remain the same.\n\nHowever,\n Twilight still felt a sense of victory over the constantly condensing \ntiles: Even if it covered up the lines she\xe2\x80\x99d created, there was still \npresence. If you looked, ever so closely, you could see that there was \nindeed a line there before;\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d merely just\xe2\x80\xa6 changed.\n\nTwilight thought back to the events of the evening, and realised that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know why\n Rainbow was bleeding so much. Well, she knew that it had some relevance\n to a collision between them, but nothing like a straight up collision \ncould have caused such a deep gash as the one Rainbow had acquired upon \nher head. To do something like that, somepony would have to use \nsomething sharp, something piercing.\n\nA\n wave of realisation overwhelmed Twilight, and she leapt to her feet, \nleaving wet hoofprints upon the floor, soon to be consumed by the \ncondensation. She staggered over to the sink, snagging a towel en route.\n However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sink Twilight was after, but the mirror above \nit.\n She slowly brought the towel up to the \nonce reflective mirror.  Shaking, Twilight slid the flannelly material \nacross the surface, and she was presented with a fleeting look at her \nown face.\nIt may well have only been distinct for a couple of seconds, but she saw it. Her horn was red.\nHowever, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sort of jolly red, not the kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with whimsical, happy things.\n\nNo.\n\nIt was a horrible red. A dark, accusatory crimson.\nEven\n though the outline was no longer visible, it was still there. Twilight \ncould see the marks on the mirror, from where the condensation hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \nquite healed over properly, and within that, she saw herself.\nShe was only a smudge, when viewed through the veil of the condensated mirror.\nShe was a Purple smudge; Indefinite.\nDashed with crimson.', 'epub': None}

She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand silence, it made her jumpy. Not that her friends would know that.\nHowever, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely correct, really. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the absence of audio that made her jumpy. It was what lies within silence.\nAnyway, Rainbow was fine, for now. The sound of the trickling water was tiding her over.\n\nIf Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk?\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be troubling,\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought; although she\xe2\x80\x99d weighed up the \nsilence with the presence of a friend, and all of a sudden, well, it \njust didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as bad.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d experienced it once before, on that cold, stormy night.\n\n A massive clap of thunder had caught her off guard, in the ambient \nsoundscape that had surrounded her, and she\xe2\x80\x99d dropped to the ground, \nfearful.\nThen that filly had rescued her, taken her in, and just sat with her. Neither of the ponies said anything, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t needed.\nJust to be together.\nTwo ponies as one.\nOnly somepony special could make her feel safe like that.\n\nOf course, Rainbow had still told her not to tell anypony about the fear she\xe2\x80\x99d experienced that night.\nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\n\nRainbow could feel another \xe2\x80\x98wave\xe2\x80\x99 of warmth gearing to flush across her face, \nso, to distract herself, she decided to see what Twilight was up to; \nShe\xe2\x80\x99d been taking her time, after all.\nAs soon as she rolled over to stand, Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings eased back out into an arc. She\n chose to ignore them, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care. Yet still, Rainbow felt \nembarrassed, as her thoughts turned to Twilight once more.\n\nAs Rainbow clopped sluggishly through the library, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fazed at all\n by the once sinister manufactured shapes of the books. Much more so was\n Rainbow worried about a sound, coming from the bathroom. A sound other \nthan the flow of water; the sound of a quietly crying filly, morose.\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard the sobs at first, but as Rainbow neared the door, each \nsob became more pronounced, a spike of noise amongst the listlessness of\n the library.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Rainbow\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow Dash froze, a mane\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from the door separating Twilight and herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99d do such a thing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight sounded pained, it was layered within every word of her voice. Not even\n the barrier of the door could take the chilling edge off of the words, \nfor Rainbow. She felt each word hit her ears, laden with despair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nTwilight broke into tears.\n\nRainbow was finding it hard to cope with Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s emotions. Each sob was worse than the last, making Rainbow feel uneasy.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d not heard much of what Twilight had been lamenting about, but it was clear that she was the source.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was too much. Rainbow had to go in. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear hearing her friend like this.\n\nRainbow brought her hoof up to the door, and tapped it, quietly, yet firmly. \nRegardless, the taps echoed around the library, accentuating their \npresence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow sounded uncertain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, Rainbow. Just give me a-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow pushed the door open, regardless. A plume of vapour hit her, filling \nher lungs with warm, moist air, and clouding her vision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight finished.\n\nTwilight was slumped upon the floor, head in hooves. Her purple, starkly against\n the black of the tiles made for a powerful contrast.\n\nIt was almost as Twilight was alone.\n\nThe tiles were streaked with indefinite misty lines, once drawn in by hoof and tear.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow tried to remain sounding calm, yet her concern for Twilight wavered through into her voice.\n\nTwilight looked down, shielding her face from Rainbow with her hoof.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-yeah?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was as quiet and as light as the vapour that hung in the air, but without the stifling heat.\n\nRainbow slowly clopped around Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s place on the floor, making a move \ntowards the seemingly hap-hazard plumbing leading to the large, old \nbathtub of the library.\nShe cranked the faucet closed, with a screeching creak that sliced through \nthe mist, breaking the tension, whilst simultaneously reinforcing it\xe2\x80\x99s \nintensity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou alright?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least she sounded more confident this time, Rainbow thought to her self, albeit a tad quizzical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight exhaled, but her huff was interjected by a spike of sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow faced Twilight once more, although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t return the gesture.\n\nRainbow thought, for a moment. She thought about how Twilight was definitely not just a bit \xe2\x80\x98You know,\xe2\x80\x99 and how Twilight had cried to herself, for some reason regarding herself.\nIf only she could remember what it was that had made Twilight feel so morose.\nRainbow knew it was to do with her, or something she\xe2\x80\x99d done.\nHowever, that somehow made it worse, as it had clearly rubbed off onto Twilight,\n but she herself, well, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the foggiest idea as to what she\xe2\x80\x99d \ndone.\n\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t terribly well versed within the art of emotions. It\n was probably down to the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d never experienced anything \nlike this before; she\xe2\x80\x99d been far too busy racing around to think about \nsuch embarrassing things.\n\nNevertheless, Rainbow was sure she could fix this; after all, she was the best young \nflier, so she could be the best at emotions, too, surely?\nThis should be easy.\n\nRainbow picked her hoof up and eased it silently towards Twilight, reaching \nthrough the vapour. She brought her hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and \nbrought her eyes up to her own.\nTwilight snapped her eyes shut, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t resist Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s soft, reassuring touch.\n\nRainbow noticed the red streaks upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn, jolting her memory. This \nwas probably what had her down; she must have been feeling guilty. Guilty for something Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even worried about.\nIt was just a small gash, nothing more.\nTwilight was overreacting, probably partially due to the alcohol she\xe2\x80\x99d consumed,\n but also probably partly to do with her obsessive, delicate \npersonality. She\xe2\x80\x99d been known to snap when under tension before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\xa6, Open your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nTwilight slowly brought her eyelids apart.\nOnly by a crack, at first, but then widening, looking up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tentative, attemptedly reassuring smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a bit shaken\xe2\x80\xa6, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get all tearful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight continued to study Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face, moving on from her smile.\nShe was a pretty pony, really, but Rainbow would probably deny the notion. \nThen again, if she\xe2\x80\x99d tried to make an effort on fabricating any sort of \xe2\x80\x98look\xe2\x80\x99, then it would probably fall down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was just the way she hung herself so nonchalantly, without a care in the world.\nEven with her wound\xe2\x80\xa6\nTwilight felt sadness well up inside her.\nEven with that unsightly gash upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, she looked good. In \nfact, it somewhat enhanced her tomboyish beauty. But she\xe2\x80\x99d just shrug it\n off, she\xe2\x80\x99d say; \xe2\x80\x98Oh that? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a scratch, no big deal!\xe2\x80\x99\n\nOh, but Rainbow, it is a big deal, Twilight thought. You need to think about yourself, too, instead of trying to please everyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, maybe you should get in the bath, to-\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow faltered, momentarily. \xe2\x80\x9c-To calm down, you seem a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nodded her head, but still managed to make it look morose, albeit \nunintentionally and slowly raised herself off the tiles.\n\nShe left uncertain hoofprints upon the floor, fading away, barely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Rainbow, I ran the bath for you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just usurp you of that pleasure, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel bad\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow smiled, more certainly than the last time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re too kind. But you need this more than me, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last couple of words seemed to peter out, back to uncertainty. \n Twilight thought it odd, hearing Rainbow Dash so tentative. She was \nusually so brash, so cocky. To hear her like this\xe2\x80\xa6 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we share?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed out in red.\n\nBut not like that dark, accusatory crimson upon her forehead.\nA jolly red, pale.\nThe kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with friends, and happiness. It made Twilight smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, get in the bath? Together?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings started to rise, slowly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, and it would be practical; we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nto run another, once one of us had finished, and well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to help \nclean up your wound\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight liked this idea, it\xe2\x80\x99d be quality time with Rainbow. She could use it to\n get to know her better, after all, they were friends, but the more \nTwilight thought about it, the more she realised how little she knew \nabout Rainbow Dash: The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\nShe ought to have a couple of interesting stories to tell her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow sounded very flustered, all of a sudden. What\xe2\x80\x99d got into her? Maybe it \nwas just the alcohol, warping her emotions slightly.\n\nTwilight clopped towards the bathtub, hauled herself into the warm water, and \nmelted in bliss. She let out a calming sigh, and stretched her legs, \nrelieving tension.\n\nTwilight looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then to her forehead, to the wound.\n\nAgainst the blush of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite as bad anymore.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Rainbow, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow halted for a moment, and then put her fore-hooves on the side of the \nbath. She looked into the water; although blurred, she could see \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\n\nThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea, Rainbow thought to herself. She should just have \nsaid no, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put Twilight down. She\xe2\x80\x99d only just come \nup, as well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be delicate, and Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shatter her \nagain. I mean, look what Twilight\xe2\x80\x99d done just by sitting on the floor by\n herself.\n\nBut Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but have inappropriate thoughts. Thoughts like that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Rainbow, you should probably close your wings first?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDamn things, always popping up uninvited. She was trying to be a friend.

She thought about how Twilight was definitely not just a bit \xe2\x80\x98You know,\xe2\x80\x99 and how Twilight had cried to herself, for some reason regarding herself.</p><p>If only she could remember what it was that had made Twilight feel so morose.</p><p>Rainbow knew it was to do with her, or something she\xe2\x80\x99d done.</p><p>However, that somehow made it worse, as it had clearly rubbed off onto Twilight,</p><p> but she herself, well, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the foggiest idea as to what she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>done.</p><p class="double">It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t terribly well versed within the art of emotions. It</p><p> was probably down to the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d never experienced anything </p><p>like this before; she\xe2\x80\x99d been far too busy racing around to think about </p><p>such embarrassing things.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, Rainbow was sure she could fix this; after all, she was the best young </p><p>flier, so she could be the best at emotions, too, surely?</p><p>This should be easy.</p><p class="double">Rainbow picked her hoof up and eased it silently towards Twilight, reaching </p><p>through the vapour. She brought her hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and </p><p>brought her eyes up to her own.</p><p>Twilight snapped her eyes shut, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t resist Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s soft, reassuring touch.</p><p class="double">Rainbow noticed the red streaks upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn, jolting her memory. This </p><p>was probably what had her down; she must have been feeling guilty. Guilty for something Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even worried about.</p><p>It was just a small gash, nothing more.</p><p>Twilight was overreacting, probably partially due to the alcohol she\xe2\x80\x99d consumed,</p><p> but also probably partly to do with her obsessive, delicate </p><p>personality. She\xe2\x80\x99d been known to snap when under tension before.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\xa6, Open your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight slowly brought her eyelids apart.</p><p>Only by a crack, at first, but then widening, looking up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tentative, attemptedly reassuring smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a bit shaken\xe2\x80\xa6, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get all tearful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight continued to study Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face, moving on from her smile.</p><p>She was a pretty pony, really, but Rainbow would probably deny the notion. </p><p>Then again, if she\xe2\x80\x99d tried to make an effort on fabricating any sort of \xe2\x80\x98look\xe2\x80\x99, then it would probably fall down.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">It was just the way she hung herself so nonchalantly, without a care in the world.</p><p>Even with her wound\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p>Twilight felt sadness well up inside her.</p><p>Even with that unsightly gash upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, she looked good. In </p><p>fact, it somewhat enhanced her tomboyish beauty. But she\xe2\x80\x99d just shrug it</p><p> off, she\xe2\x80\x99d say; \xe2\x80\x98Oh that? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a scratch, no big deal!\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Oh, but Rainbow, it is a big deal, Twilight thought. You need to think about yourself, too, instead of trying to please everyone.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, maybe you should get in the bath, to-\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow faltered, momentarily. \xe2\x80\x9c-To calm down, you seem a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded her head, but still managed to make it look morose, albeit </p><p>unintentionally and slowly raised herself off the tiles.</p><p class="double">She left uncertain hoofprints upon the floor, fading away, barely there.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut Rainbow, I ran the bath for you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just usurp you of that pleasure, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel bad\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow smiled, more certainly than the last time.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re too kind. But you need this more than me, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The last couple of words seemed to peter out, back to uncertainty. </p><p> Twilight thought it odd, hearing Rainbow Dash so tentative. She was </p><p>usually so brash, so cocky. To hear her like this\xe2\x80\xa6 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we share?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed out in red.</p><p class="double">But not like that dark, accusatory crimson upon her forehead.</p><p>A jolly red, pale.</p><p>The kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with friends, and happiness. It made Twilight smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, get in the bath? Together?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings started to rise, slowly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, and it would be practical; we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have </p><p>to run another, once one of us had finished, and well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to help </p><p>clean up your wound\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight liked this idea, it\xe2\x80\x99d be quality time with Rainbow. She could use it to</p><p> get to know her better, after all, they were friends, but the more </p><p>Twilight thought about it, the more she realised how little she knew </p><p>about Rainbow Dash: The fastest flier in all of Equestria!</p><p>She ought to have a couple of interesting stories to tell her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure...\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow sounded very flustered, all of a sudden. What\xe2\x80\x99d got into her? Maybe it </p><p>was just the alcohol, warping her emotions slightly.</p><p class="double">Twilight clopped towards the bathtub, hauled herself into the warm water, and </p><p>melted in bliss. She let out a calming sigh, and stretched her legs, </p><p>relieving tension.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then to her forehead, to the wound.</p><p class="double">Against the blush of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite as bad anymore.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Rainbow, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow halted for a moment, and then put her fore-hooves on the side of the </p><p>bath. She looked into the water; although blurred, she could see </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s legs.</p><p class="double">This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea, Rainbow thought to herself. She should just have </p><p>said no, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put Twilight down. She\xe2\x80\x99d only just come </p><p>up, as well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be delicate, and Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shatter her </p><p>again. I mean, look what Twilight\xe2\x80\x99d done just by sitting on the floor by</p><p> herself.</p><p class="double">But Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but have inappropriate thoughts. Thoughts like that.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Rainbow, you should probably close your wings first?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Damn things, always popping up uninvited.

She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand silence, it made her jumpy. Not that her friends would know that.\nHowever, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely correct, really. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the absence of audio that made her jumpy. It was what lies within silence.\nAnyway, Rainbow was fine, for now. The sound of the trickling water was tiding her over.\n\nIf Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk?\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be troubling,\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought; although she\xe2\x80\x99d weighed up the \nsilence with the presence of a friend, and all of a sudden, well, it \njust didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as bad.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d experienced it once before, on that cold, stormy night.\n\n A massive clap of thunder had caught her off guard, in the ambient \nsoundscape that had surrounded her, and she\xe2\x80\x99d dropped to the ground, \nfearful.\nThen that filly had rescued her, taken her in, and just sat with her. Neither of the ponies said anything, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t needed.\nJust to be together.\nTwo ponies as one.\nOnly somepony special could make her feel safe like that.\n\nOf course, Rainbow had still told her not to tell anypony about the fear she\xe2\x80\x99d experienced that night.\nIt just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\n\nRainbow could feel another \xe2\x80\x98wave\xe2\x80\x99 of warmth gearing to flush across her face, \nso, to distract herself, she decided to see what Twilight was up to; \nShe\xe2\x80\x99d been taking her time, after all.\nAs soon as she rolled over to stand, Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings eased back out into an arc. She\n chose to ignore them, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care. Yet still, Rainbow felt \nembarrassed, as her thoughts turned to Twilight once more.\n\nAs Rainbow clopped sluggishly through the library, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fazed at all\n by the once sinister manufactured shapes of the books. Much more so was\n Rainbow worried about a sound, coming from the bathroom. A sound other \nthan the flow of water; the sound of a quietly crying filly, morose.\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard the sobs at first, but as Rainbow neared the door, each \nsob became more pronounced, a spike of noise amongst the listlessness of\n the library.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Rainbow\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow Dash froze, a mane\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from the door separating Twilight and herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99d do such a thing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight sounded pained, it was layered within every word of her voice. Not even\n the barrier of the door could take the chilling edge off of the words, \nfor Rainbow. She felt each word hit her ears, laden with despair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nTwilight broke into tears.\n\nRainbow was finding it hard to cope with Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s emotions. Each sob was worse than the last, making Rainbow feel uneasy.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d not heard much of what Twilight had been lamenting about, but it was clear that she was the source.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was too much. Rainbow had to go in. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear hearing her friend like this.\n\nRainbow brought her hoof up to the door, and tapped it, quietly, yet firmly. \nRegardless, the taps echoed around the library, accentuating their \npresence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow sounded uncertain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, Rainbow. Just give me a-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow pushed the door open, regardless. A plume of vapour hit her, filling \nher lungs with warm, moist air, and clouding her vision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight finished.\n\nTwilight was slumped upon the floor, head in hooves. Her purple, starkly against\n the black of the tiles made for a powerful contrast.\n\nIt was almost as Twilight was alone.\n\nThe tiles were streaked with indefinite misty lines, once drawn in by hoof and tear.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow tried to remain sounding calm, yet her concern for Twilight wavered through into her voice.\n\nTwilight looked down, shielding her face from Rainbow with her hoof.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-yeah?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was as quiet and as light as the vapour that hung in the air, but without the stifling heat.\n\nRainbow slowly clopped around Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s place on the floor, making a move \ntowards the seemingly hap-hazard plumbing leading to the large, old \nbathtub of the library.\nShe cranked the faucet closed, with a screeching creak that sliced through \nthe mist, breaking the tension, whilst simultaneously reinforcing it\xe2\x80\x99s \nintensity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou alright?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least she sounded more confident this time, Rainbow thought to her self, albeit a tad quizzical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight exhaled, but her huff was interjected by a spike of sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow faced Twilight once more, although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t return the gesture.\n\nRainbow thought, for a moment. She thought about how Twilight was definitely not just a bit \xe2\x80\x98You know,\xe2\x80\x99 and how Twilight had cried to herself, for some reason regarding herself.\nIf only she could remember what it was that had made Twilight feel so morose.\nRainbow knew it was to do with her, or something she\xe2\x80\x99d done.\nHowever, that somehow made it worse, as it had clearly rubbed off onto Twilight,\n but she herself, well, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the foggiest idea as to what she\xe2\x80\x99d \ndone.\n\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t terribly well versed within the art of emotions. It\n was probably down to the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d never experienced anything \nlike this before; she\xe2\x80\x99d been far too busy racing around to think about \nsuch embarrassing things.\n\nNevertheless, Rainbow was sure she could fix this; after all, she was the best young \nflier, so she could be the best at emotions, too, surely?\nThis should be easy.\n\nRainbow picked her hoof up and eased it silently towards Twilight, reaching \nthrough the vapour. She brought her hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and \nbrought her eyes up to her own.\nTwilight snapped her eyes shut, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t resist Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s soft, reassuring touch.\n\nRainbow noticed the red streaks upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s horn, jolting her memory. This \nwas probably what had her down; she must have been feeling guilty. Guilty for something Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even worried about.\nIt was just a small gash, nothing more.\nTwilight was overreacting, probably partially due to the alcohol she\xe2\x80\x99d consumed,\n but also probably partly to do with her obsessive, delicate \npersonality. She\xe2\x80\x99d been known to snap when under tension before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\xa6, Open your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nTwilight slowly brought her eyelids apart.\nOnly by a crack, at first, but then widening, looking up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tentative, attemptedly reassuring smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a bit shaken\xe2\x80\xa6, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get all tearful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight continued to study Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face, moving on from her smile.\nShe was a pretty pony, really, but Rainbow would probably deny the notion. \nThen again, if she\xe2\x80\x99d tried to make an effort on fabricating any sort of \xe2\x80\x98look\xe2\x80\x99, then it would probably fall down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was just the way she hung herself so nonchalantly, without a care in the world.\nEven with her wound\xe2\x80\xa6\nTwilight felt sadness well up inside her.\nEven with that unsightly gash upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, she looked good. In \nfact, it somewhat enhanced her tomboyish beauty. But she\xe2\x80\x99d just shrug it\n off, she\xe2\x80\x99d say; \xe2\x80\x98Oh that? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a scratch, no big deal!\xe2\x80\x99\n\nOh, but Rainbow, it is a big deal, Twilight thought. You need to think about yourself, too, instead of trying to please everyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, maybe you should get in the bath, to-\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow faltered, momentarily. \xe2\x80\x9c-To calm down, you seem a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nodded her head, but still managed to make it look morose, albeit \nunintentionally and slowly raised herself off the tiles.\n\nShe left uncertain hoofprints upon the floor, fading away, barely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Rainbow, I ran the bath for you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just usurp you of that pleasure, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel bad\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow smiled, more certainly than the last time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re too kind. But you need this more than me, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last couple of words seemed to peter out, back to uncertainty. \n Twilight thought it odd, hearing Rainbow Dash so tentative. She was \nusually so brash, so cocky. To hear her like this\xe2\x80\xa6 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we share?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed out in red.\n\nBut not like that dark, accusatory crimson upon her forehead.\nA jolly red, pale.\nThe kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with friends, and happiness. It made Twilight smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, get in the bath? Together?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings started to rise, slowly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, and it would be practical; we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nto run another, once one of us had finished, and well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to help \nclean up your wound\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight liked this idea, it\xe2\x80\x99d be quality time with Rainbow. She could use it to\n get to know her better, after all, they were friends, but the more \nTwilight thought about it, the more she realised how little she knew \nabout Rainbow Dash: The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\nShe ought to have a couple of interesting stories to tell her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow sounded very flustered, all of a sudden. What\xe2\x80\x99d got into her? Maybe it \nwas just the alcohol, warping her emotions slightly.\n\nTwilight clopped towards the bathtub, hauled herself into the warm water, and \nmelted in bliss. She let out a calming sigh, and stretched her legs, \nrelieving tension.\n\nTwilight looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then to her forehead, to the wound.\n\nAgainst the blush of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite as bad anymore.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Rainbow, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow halted for a moment, and then put her fore-hooves on the side of the \nbath. She looked into the water; although blurred, she could see \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\n\nThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea, Rainbow thought to herself. She should just have \nsaid no, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put Twilight down. She\xe2\x80\x99d only just come \nup, as well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be delicate, and Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shatter her \nagain. I mean, look what Twilight\xe2\x80\x99d done just by sitting on the floor by\n herself.\n\nBut Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but have inappropriate thoughts. Thoughts like that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Rainbow, you should probably close your wings first?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDamn things, always popping up uninvited. She was trying to be a friend.

She\xe2\x80\x99d been known to snap when under tension before.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\xa6, Open your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight slowly brought her eyelids apart.</p><p>Only by a crack, at first, but then widening, looking up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tentative, attemptedly reassuring smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a bit shaken\xe2\x80\xa6, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get all tearful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight continued to study Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face, moving on from her smile.</p><p>She was a pretty pony, really, but Rainbow would probably deny the notion. </p><p>Then again, if she\xe2\x80\x99d tried to make an effort on fabricating any sort of \xe2\x80\x98look\xe2\x80\x99, then it would probably fall down.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">It was just the way she hung herself so nonchalantly, without a care in the world.</p><p>Even with her wound\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p>Twilight felt sadness well up inside her.</p><p>Even with that unsightly gash upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, she looked good.

It\xe2\x80\x99s just a scratch, no big deal!\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Oh, but Rainbow, it is a big deal, Twilight thought.

But you need this more than me, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The last couple of words seemed to peter out, back to uncertainty. </p><p> Twilight thought it odd, hearing Rainbow Dash so tentative. She was </p><p>usually so brash, so cocky. To hear her like this\xe2\x80\xa6 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we share?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed out in red.</p><p class="double">But not like that dark, accusatory crimson upon her forehead.</p><p>A jolly red, pale.</p><p>The kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with friends, and happiness. It made Twilight smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, get in the bath? Together?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings started to rise, slowly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, and it would be practical; we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have </p><p>to run another, once one of us had finished, and well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to help </p><p>clean up your wound\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight liked this idea, it\xe2\x80\x99d be quality time with Rainbow. She could use it to</p><p> get to know her better, after all, they were friends, but the more </p><p>Twilight thought about it, the more she realised how little she knew </p><p>about Rainbow Dash: The fastest flier in all of Equestria!</p><p>She ought to have a couple of interesting stories to tell her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure...\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow sounded very flustered, all of a sudden. What\xe2\x80\x99d got into her? Maybe it </p><p>was just the alcohol, warping her emotions slightly.</p><p class="double">Twilight clopped towards the bathtub, hauled herself into the warm water, and </p><p>melted in bliss. She let out a calming sigh, and stretched her legs, </p><p>relieving tension.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then to her forehead, to the wound.</p><p class="double">Against the blush of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite as bad anymore.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Rainbow, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow halted for a moment, and then put her fore-hooves on the side of the </p><p>bath. She looked into the water; although blurred, she could see </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s legs.</p><p class="double">This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea, Rainbow thought to herself. She should just have </p><p>said no, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put Twilight down. She\xe2\x80\x99d only just come </p><p>up, as well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be delicate, and Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shatter her </p><p>again. I mean, look what Twilight\xe2\x80\x99d done just by sitting on the floor by</p><p> herself.</p><p class="double">But Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but have inappropriate thoughts.

Guilty for something Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even worried about.\nIt was just a small gash, nothing more.\nTwilight was overreacting, probably partially due to the alcohol she\xe2\x80\x99d consumed,\n but also probably partly to do with her obsessive, delicate \npersonality. She\xe2\x80\x99d been known to snap when under tension before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\xa6, Open your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nTwilight slowly brought her eyelids apart.\nOnly by a crack, at first, but then widening, looking up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s tentative, attemptedly reassuring smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a bit shaken\xe2\x80\xa6, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not get all tearful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight continued to study Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face, moving on from her smile.\nShe was a pretty pony, really, but Rainbow would probably deny the notion. \nThen again, if she\xe2\x80\x99d tried to make an effort on fabricating any sort of \xe2\x80\x98look\xe2\x80\x99, then it would probably fall down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was just the way she hung herself so nonchalantly, without a care in the world.\nEven with her wound\xe2\x80\xa6\nTwilight felt sadness well up inside her.\nEven with that unsightly gash upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, she looked good. In \nfact, it somewhat enhanced her tomboyish beauty. But she\xe2\x80\x99d just shrug it\n off, she\xe2\x80\x99d say; \xe2\x80\x98Oh that? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a scratch, no big deal!\xe2\x80\x99\n\nOh, but Rainbow, it is a big deal, Twilight thought. You need to think about yourself, too, instead of trying to please everyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, maybe you should get in the bath, to-\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow faltered, momentarily. \xe2\x80\x9c-To calm down, you seem a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nodded her head, but still managed to make it look morose, albeit \nunintentionally and slowly raised herself off the tiles.\n\nShe left uncertain hoofprints upon the floor, fading away, barely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Rainbow, I ran the bath for you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just usurp you of that pleasure, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel bad\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow smiled, more certainly than the last time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99re too kind. But you need this more than me, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last couple of words seemed to peter out, back to uncertainty. \n Twilight thought it odd, hearing Rainbow Dash so tentative. She was \nusually so brash, so cocky. To hear her like this\xe2\x80\xa6 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we share?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed out in red.\n\nBut not like that dark, accusatory crimson upon her forehead.\nA jolly red, pale.\nThe kind of red you\xe2\x80\x99d associate with friends, and happiness. It made Twilight smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, get in the bath? Together?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s wings started to rise, slowly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, and it would be practical; we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nto run another, once one of us had finished, and well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to help \nclean up your wound\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight liked this idea, it\xe2\x80\x99d be quality time with Rainbow. She could use it to\n get to know her better, after all, they were friends, but the more \nTwilight thought about it, the more she realised how little she knew \nabout Rainbow Dash: The fastest flier in all of Equestria!\nShe ought to have a couple of interesting stories to tell her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow sounded very flustered, all of a sudden. What\xe2\x80\x99d got into her? Maybe it \nwas just the alcohol, warping her emotions slightly.\n\nTwilight clopped towards the bathtub, hauled herself into the warm water, and \nmelted in bliss. She let out a calming sigh, and stretched her legs, \nrelieving tension.\n\nTwilight looked into Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then to her forehead, to the wound.\n\nAgainst the blush of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite as bad anymore.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on Rainbow, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow halted for a moment, and then put her fore-hooves on the side of the \nbath. She looked into the water; although blurred, she could see \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\n\nThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea, Rainbow thought to herself. She should just have \nsaid no, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put Twilight down. She\xe2\x80\x99d only just come \nup, as well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be delicate, and Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shatter her \nagain. I mean, look what Twilight\xe2\x80\x99d done just by sitting on the floor by\n herself.\n\nBut Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but have inappropriate thoughts. Thoughts like that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh, Rainbow, you should probably close your wings first?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDamn things, always popping up uninvited. She was trying to be a friend. Twilight was vulnerable, melancholic, and yet Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s body had other ideas. She just wanted to help!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, Twi\xe2\x80\x99, I already got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow tested the water with her hoof, it was an amiable temperature. The kind\n of warmth you\xe2\x80\x99d get that makes you just want to sleep, forever.\n\nRainbow faltered once more, looking down at the seemingly impenetrable water\xe2\x80\x99s \nsurface, even thought her hoof was touching it, not even ten seconds \nago.\n\nShe would try to be a good friend, even if she had to hang her own feelings.\n\nNo, Rainbow wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d be the best friend there could be.\n\nForcing herself, she took the plunge.\n', 'epub': None}

Right.\nIf only she could stop thinking about the current situation. Twilight and herself, in a bath, together.\nIt was all far too exciting.\nRainbow sighed, melancholically; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let Twilight know that she was even remotely\n into fillies. Plus, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Rainbow lusted after each and every \nfilly; it was just the select couple: Twilight, and that other filly, but somehow, that made it worse.\n\nStill, she had to make it look otherwise, after all, there were reasons Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told anypony about these feelings.\nShe had to play it cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, if you lean up against me, I can clean up your-\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice panged with a twinge of guilt. \xe2\x80\x9cInjury.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere goes that innocence again. Does Twilight not see the intimacy in that position?\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Play it cool, Dash. Play it cool.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith her newly devised internal mantra, Rainbow tentatively shifted backwards, the film of the water ever-clinging to her body.\n\nHer\n back made contact with Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s belly, its warmth sending shivers \ndown Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s spine. It was odd, warmth giving her the shivers, but she\n was more shocked at how Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s warmth differed from that of regular warmth.\nThe warmth of a living, loving pony.\nNot the warmth of a cold, inanimate object.\n\nRainbow\n laid back into Twilight, overcome with emotions, deciding that focusing\n on her mantra was more important than keeping bodily composure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good. Rainbow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I touch your forehead, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYes, right, that\xe2\x80\x99s why she was here, so Twilight could help her clean up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, it should be fine, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Great, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stuttered,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow, \xe2\x80\x98and on top of that, I accentuated her name a bit too much\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, just tell me if it hurts, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n juddered her head, ever so slightly, to show the affirmative. It was \nthe reaction that used the least amount of concentration; she needed it,\n after all. She needed it to keep on top of her mantra. She needed it to\n keep her wings down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n spoke nonchalantly, as if this was no different to a regular \nconversation. As if there was nothing that hung in the air; only \nvapours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow\n began to answer, but Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s manoeuvres caught her off guard. \nTwilight leant forwards, pushing into Rainbow, their bodies locking \ntogether, in an unintentional embrace, becoming one.\n Rainbow felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoof; tracing along her shoulder, moving \ntowards her face, carefully brushing her mane away, to reveal her tender\n wound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, Rainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWow, Twilight really was clueless. It was clear from her voice; there were no quiet, husky whispers, just stark, everyday voices.\nThis made Rainbow feel a bit more at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight, I should make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n was glad she\xe2\x80\x99d managed to get the words out this time, she\xe2\x80\x99d show \nTwilight just how confident Rainbow Dash; Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s best young flier \ncould be!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, I shall look forward to seeing you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still normal. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to clean your wound now, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n brought her leg up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, with flannel in hoof. She \nbrushed across the cut, slowly, tentatively. It hurt, but Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t\n mind; she could feel the affection Twilight was putting into her care, \nand it was like anaesthesia.\n\nRainbow\n closed her eyes, to divert her feelings; both the pain and the blush \nthreatening to coarse their way across her forehead. She thought about \nTwilight and herself; how had they ended up in this situation?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, your head is all cleaned up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n opened her eyes, and looked down. The water was contaminated with red. \nRed, watered down from her blood, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look sinister, it was \nmore reminiscent of love.\nHah;\n Twilight, if only you knew, my head is far from clean, inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s as \nconvoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water. But \nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t know; you\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least she was still confident in her speech, if not in mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to help out a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s body relent for a second, a cool rush of air in place \nof where their pelts pressed together. Rainbow sighed for a second, \nrelieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking \nunder her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, \npulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head \nupon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\n Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how \nRainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her \nstomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \nseemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or\n the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,\n regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like \nthis was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,\n still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, \nand moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.\n\nShe felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.\n\nRainbow\n dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady \nherself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would \nlet her, to face Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to \nconnect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, \ntentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.\n\nRainbow\n was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her \nlavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.\n\nTwilight\n was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof\n out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and \nslowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.\nSubtle.\n\nBut definitely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.\n\nRainbow\n stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly \nruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her \neyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple\n irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a \nred bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, \nthe melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem \nall the more vivid, all the more real.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\n a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in \nits place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nTwilight\n looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her\n face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRainbow\n felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow \nweaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little \nresistance,  pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches \nbrushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.\n\nAll\n the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every \nlast detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,\n how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if\n looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, \ninto deep purple.\n\nRainbow\n took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, \npulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the \nindefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her \nwings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.\n\nRainbow\n slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon \nher. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate\n prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\nHowever,\n instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head \nover to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was \nclosing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice \nshe could;\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \ncheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting \naccident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was \naccompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was \nfine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of \nmillimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent \nkiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, \nsomething that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but \nstill almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a \nlook of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.\n\nThe\n gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words \nweren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in \nstories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short \ndistance between herself and Twilight.\n\nAgain,\n they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a \nfraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their\n mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,\n but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.\n\nRainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.\n\nRainbow\n slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join \nthe dance, to share the ecstasy.\n\nWithin\n their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in \nmere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of \nemotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of\n expressing her self further. She brought her left hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s\n mane, tracing its way up her back, as she went, stroking.\n\nThe rush of emotions was hard, for Rainbow. Although it was beautiful, it was just so\xe2\x80\xa6 Intense. She\xe2\x80\x99d only experienced emotions like that once before, during her times with that filly.\n\nWith that filly\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nA wave of guilt came over Rainbow, overcoming the new, intense emotions.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away from Twilight, prising her tongue from its lustful dance, \nbringing her hooves back in check, breaking Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and \nfinally, prolonged by Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eager leaning forwards; Rainbow broke \nthe kiss.\n\nFor\n a moment, a thin, delicate string of saliva connected the two fillies, \nglistening, only to be shattered by Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s drive to look down, into \nthe void filled by reddened water, where they once connected so \ntenderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m, so sorry,\n Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow spoke to the water, in a tiny voice. Her words were \nabsorbed, without a reply. In an even tinier, almost inaudible tone, she\n continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n got to all fours, and dripping blood-tinged water back into the bath, \nshe flapped her already-erect wings, and flew out the door; spraying red\n back into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s bemused, disconcerted eyes.\n\nShe\n found the library front door easily, and threw in open, but in her \nfrantic haste, Rainbow neglected the idea of closing it behind her.\n\nAs\n the cold night air whipped past her in the sky, chilling her sopping \nwet pelt; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less, she just repeated the same \nhysterical thoughts around in her head:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia; I\xe2\x80\x99ve betrayed them both, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been disloyal. And I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be the element of Loyalty\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*****\n\n\nThe\n bath water had long since become frigid, yet Twilight still remained in\n the reddened mixture, beginning to wrinkle, but still in the same \nposition that Rainbow had left her in. However, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t care \nthat she was cold and wrinkling, or rather, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\nShe\n was too busy desperately trying to piece together what\xe2\x80\x99d just happened.\n There had to be a reason, she knew it; things didn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.\n There was always cause and effect, as science would have her know. \nAlso, if she looked into her magic studies, she knew that Rainbow would \nnever leave like that, not if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have good reason to, she was the Element of Loyalty, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\nEven so, Twilight would have liked to have had an explanation for the whole thing.\n She\xe2\x80\x99d been enjoying her time with Rainbow, even if it was unexpected, \nshe\xe2\x80\x99d thought they were just sharing a bath out of necessity, like \nTwilight used to when she was small. She\xe2\x80\x99d been taken aback, but it \nseemed like the right thing to do, after all, she was here to learn \nabout the magic of friendship.\nTwilight\n sighed to her self, and stood up on all fours, mirroring Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nimage, and levitated the same towel that she\xe2\x80\x99d used to clear the mirror \nto her. With a sinking feeling within her stomach, Twilight thought to \nherself;\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does friendship have to be so\xe2\x80\xa6 Complicated?\xe2\x80\x9d\nTears came back to Twilight, involuntarily, delicately, leaving sorrow behind, slowly diluting the reddened water.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow\n was tired, even after just ten minutes of flying, but she attributed \nthis to the mach speed at which her brain was whirring at; not how the \nevening had taken its toll on her athletic body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal; I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she landed, Rainbow felt a small pang of bittersweet satisfaction; she\xe2\x80\x99d made it this far.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were dimming, now, out of exhaustion, but she could still focus on what she\xe2\x80\x99d come for.\n\nShe hesitantly crept forwards, towards the window she\xe2\x80\x99d come for. It was open a crack, like a small glimmer of hope.\n\nRainbow\n brought her hoof up to the window, and pushed it open, the pane of \nglass sliding silently into the dark stillness of the room. She timidly \nhauled herself over the windowsill, landing in the room with a silent \nclop.\n\nThere were shadows, all of unnatural, unnerving shapes, carved by moonlight, not dissimilar to that of Twili- Of the library\xe2\x80\x99s shadows.\n Nevertheless, Rainbow did her best to ignore them, and honed in on a \nmore toned, natural looking shadow, laid on top of what seemed to be a \nbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice was ghostly, diminished in the dead of the bedroom.\n\nShe\n sighed, with a tint of frustration; she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be louder. Rainbow \nbrought her voice up to a loud, firm, important tone, and with a hint of\n apprehension, announced:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you; Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'chapter_number': 4, 'parent_chapter_id': 30, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'4\'></a><h3>Wanting</h3>\n<p>The warmth of the water engulfed Rainbow, she could feel its swirling </p><p>encapsulate her; capture her, even more so than the vapour did.</p><p>Now?</p><p> The once warm, oppressive vapour was now like fresh air, for Rainbow. </p><p>Now it was the water that was clingy, effortlessly smothering her body, </p><p>she was in its grip.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking awfully stiff!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was stating the obvious for her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you lean back and relax?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Yeah, relax.

It\xe2\x80\x99s as </p><p>convoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water.

Rainbow sighed for a second, </p><p>relieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking </p><p>under her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, </p><p>pulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head </p><p>upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh,</p><p> Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how </p><p>Rainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her </p><p>stomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>seemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or</p><p> the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,</p><p> regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like </p><p>this was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,</p><p> still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, </p><p>and moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.</p><p class="double">She felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady </p><p>herself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would </p><p>let her, to face Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to </p><p>connect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, </p><p>tentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her </p><p>lavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof</p><p> out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and </p><p>slowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p class="double">But definitely there.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly </p><p>ruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her </p><p>eyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple</p><p> irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a </p><p>red bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, </p><p>the melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem </p><p>all the more vivid, all the more real.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re</p><p> a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in </p><p>its place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her</p><p> face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow </p><p>weaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little </p><p>resistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches </p><p>brushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.</p><p class="double">All</p><p> the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every </p><p>last detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,</p><p> how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if</p><p> looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, </p><p>into deep purple.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, </p><p>pulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the </p><p>indefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her </p><p>wings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon </p><p>her. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate</p><p> prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="double">However,</p><p> instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head </p><p>over to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was </p><p>closing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice </p><p>she could;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>cheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting </p><p>accident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was </p><p>accompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was </p><p>fine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of </p><p>millimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent </p><p>kiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, </p><p>something that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but </p><p>still almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a </p><p>look of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.</p><p class="double">The</p><p> gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words </p><p>weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in </p><p>stories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short </p><p>distance between herself and Twilight.</p><p class="double">Again,</p><p> they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a </p><p>fraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their</p><p> mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,</p><p> but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join </p><p>the dance, to share the ecstasy.</p><p class="double">Within</p><p> their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in </p><p>mere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of </p><p>emotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of</p><p> expressing her self further. She brought her left hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> mane, tracing its way up her back, as she went, stroking.</p><p class="double">The rush of emotions was hard, for Rainbow. Although it was beautiful, it was just so\xe2\x80\xa6 Intense. She\xe2\x80\x99d only experienced emotions like that once before, during her times with that filly.</p><p class="double">With that filly\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">A wave of guilt came over Rainbow, overcoming the new, intense emotions.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> pulled away from Twilight, prising her tongue from its lustful dance, </p><p>bringing her hooves back in check, breaking Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and </p><p>finally, prolonged by Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eager leaning forwards; Rainbow broke </p><p>the kiss.</p><p class="double">For</p><p> a moment, a thin, delicate string of saliva connected the two fillies, </p><p>glistening, only to be shattered by Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s drive to look down, into </p><p>the void filled by reddened water, where they once connected so </p><p>tenderly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m, so sorry,</p><p> Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow spoke to the water, in a tiny voice. Her words were </p><p>absorbed, without a reply. In an even tinier, almost inaudible tone, she</p><p> continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> got to all fours, and dripping blood-tinged water back into the bath, </p><p>she flapped her already-erect wings, and flew out the door; spraying red</p><p> back into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s bemused, disconcerted eyes.</p><p class="double">She</p><p> found the library front door easily, and threw in open, but in her </p><p>frantic haste, Rainbow neglected the idea of closing it behind her.</p><p class="double">As</p><p> the cold night air whipped past her in the sky, chilling her sopping </p><p>wet pelt; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less, she just repeated the same </p><p>hysterical thoughts around in her head:</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia; I\xe2\x80\x99ve betrayed them both, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been disloyal.

However, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t care </p><p>that she was cold and wrinkling, or rather, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.</p><p>She</p><p> was too busy desperately trying to piece together what\xe2\x80\x99d just happened.</p><p> There had to be a reason, she knew it; things didn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.</p><p> There was always cause and effect, as science would have her know. </p><p>Also, if she looked into her magic studies, she knew that Rainbow would </p><p>never leave like that, not if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have good reason to, she was the Element of Loyalty, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p>Even so, Twilight would have liked to have had an explanation for the whole thing.</p><p> She\xe2\x80\x99d been enjoying her time with Rainbow, even if it was unexpected, </p><p>she\xe2\x80\x99d thought they were just sharing a bath out of necessity, like </p><p>Twilight used to when she was small. She\xe2\x80\x99d been taken aback, but it </p><p>seemed like the right thing to do, after all, she was here to learn </p><p>about the magic of friendship.</p><p>Twilight</p><p> sighed to her self, and stood up on all fours, mirroring Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>image, and levitated the same towel that she\xe2\x80\x99d used to clear the mirror </p><p>to her. With a sinking feeling within her stomach, Twilight thought to </p><p>herself;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does friendship have to be so\xe2\x80\xa6 Complicated?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Tears came back to Twilight, involuntarily, delicately, leaving sorrow behind, slowly diluting the reddened water.</p><p class="double"></p><p>*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow</p><p> was tired, even after just ten minutes of flying, but she attributed </p><p>this to the mach speed at which her brain was whirring at; not how the </p><p>evening had taken its toll on her athletic body.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal; I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">As she landed, Rainbow felt a small pang of bittersweet satisfaction; she\xe2\x80\x99d made it this far.</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were dimming, now, out of exhaustion, but she could still focus on what she\xe2\x80\x99d come for.</p><p class="double">She hesitantly crept forwards, towards the window she\xe2\x80\x99d come for. It was open a crack, like a small glimmer of hope.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> brought her hoof up to the window, and pushed it open, the pane of </p><p>glass sliding silently into the dark stillness of the room. She timidly </p><p>hauled herself over the windowsill, landing in the room with a silent </p><p>clop.</p><p class="double">There were shadows, all of unnatural, unnerving shapes, carved by moonlight, not dissimilar to that of Twili- Of the library\xe2\x80\x99s shadows.</p><p> Nevertheless, Rainbow did her best to ignore them, and honed in on a </p><p>more toned, natural looking shadow, laid on top of what seemed to be a </p><p>bed.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice was ghostly, diminished in the dead of the bedroom.</p><p class="double">She</p><p> sighed, with a tint of frustration; she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be louder.

She </p><p>brushed across the cut, slowly, tentatively. It hurt, but Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t</p><p> mind; she could feel the affection Twilight was putting into her care, </p><p>and it was like anaesthesia.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> closed her eyes, to divert her feelings; both the pain and the blush </p><p>threatening to coarse their way across her forehead.

The water was contaminated with red. </p><p>Red, watered down from her blood, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look sinister, it was </p><p>more reminiscent of love.</p><p>Hah;</p><p> Twilight, if only you knew, my head is far from clean, inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s as </p><p>convoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water.

Rainbow sighed for a second, </p><p>relieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking </p><p>under her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, </p><p>pulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head </p><p>upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh,</p><p> Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how </p><p>Rainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her </p><p>stomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>seemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or</p><p> the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,</p><p> regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like </p><p>this was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,</p><p> still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, </p><p>and moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.</p><p class="double">She felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady </p><p>herself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would </p><p>let her, to face Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to </p><p>connect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, </p><p>tentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her </p><p>lavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof</p><p> out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and </p><p>slowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p class="double">But definitely there.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly </p><p>ruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her </p><p>eyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple</p><p> irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a </p><p>red bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, </p><p>the melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem </p><p>all the more vivid, all the more real.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re</p><p> a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in </p><p>its place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her</p><p> face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow </p><p>weaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little </p><p>resistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches </p><p>brushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.</p><p class="double">All</p><p> the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every </p><p>last detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,</p><p> how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if</p><p> looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, </p><p>into deep purple.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, </p><p>pulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the </p><p>indefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her </p><p>wings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon </p><p>her. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate</p><p> prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="double">However,</p><p> instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head </p><p>over to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was </p><p>closing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice </p><p>she could;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>cheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting </p><p>accident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was </p><p>accompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was </p><p>fine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of </p><p>millimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent </p><p>kiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, </p><p>something that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but </p><p>still almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a </p><p>look of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.</p><p class="double">The</p><p> gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words </p><p>weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in </p><p>stories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short </p><p>distance between herself and Twilight.</p><p class="double">Again,</p><p> they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a </p><p>fraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their</p><p> mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,</p><p> but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join </p><p>the dance, to share the ecstasy.</p><p class="double">Within</p><p> their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in </p><p>mere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of </p><p>emotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of</p><p> expressing her self further.

Right.\nIf only she could stop thinking about the current situation. Twilight and herself, in a bath, together.\nIt was all far too exciting.\nRainbow sighed, melancholically; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let Twilight know that she was even remotely\n into fillies. Plus, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Rainbow lusted after each and every \nfilly; it was just the select couple: Twilight, and that other filly, but somehow, that made it worse.\n\nStill, she had to make it look otherwise, after all, there were reasons Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told anypony about these feelings.\nShe had to play it cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, if you lean up against me, I can clean up your-\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice panged with a twinge of guilt. \xe2\x80\x9cInjury.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere goes that innocence again. Does Twilight not see the intimacy in that position?\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Play it cool, Dash. Play it cool.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith her newly devised internal mantra, Rainbow tentatively shifted backwards, the film of the water ever-clinging to her body.\n\nHer\n back made contact with Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s belly, its warmth sending shivers \ndown Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s spine. It was odd, warmth giving her the shivers, but she\n was more shocked at how Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s warmth differed from that of regular warmth.\nThe warmth of a living, loving pony.\nNot the warmth of a cold, inanimate object.\n\nRainbow\n laid back into Twilight, overcome with emotions, deciding that focusing\n on her mantra was more important than keeping bodily composure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good. Rainbow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I touch your forehead, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYes, right, that\xe2\x80\x99s why she was here, so Twilight could help her clean up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, it should be fine, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Great, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stuttered,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow, \xe2\x80\x98and on top of that, I accentuated her name a bit too much\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, just tell me if it hurts, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n juddered her head, ever so slightly, to show the affirmative. It was \nthe reaction that used the least amount of concentration; she needed it,\n after all. She needed it to keep on top of her mantra. She needed it to\n keep her wings down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n spoke nonchalantly, as if this was no different to a regular \nconversation. As if there was nothing that hung in the air; only \nvapours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow\n began to answer, but Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s manoeuvres caught her off guard. \nTwilight leant forwards, pushing into Rainbow, their bodies locking \ntogether, in an unintentional embrace, becoming one.\n Rainbow felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoof; tracing along her shoulder, moving \ntowards her face, carefully brushing her mane away, to reveal her tender\n wound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, Rainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWow, Twilight really was clueless. It was clear from her voice; there were no quiet, husky whispers, just stark, everyday voices.\nThis made Rainbow feel a bit more at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight, I should make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n was glad she\xe2\x80\x99d managed to get the words out this time, she\xe2\x80\x99d show \nTwilight just how confident Rainbow Dash; Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s best young flier \ncould be!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, I shall look forward to seeing you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still normal. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to clean your wound now, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n brought her leg up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, with flannel in hoof. She \nbrushed across the cut, slowly, tentatively. It hurt, but Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t\n mind; she could feel the affection Twilight was putting into her care, \nand it was like anaesthesia.\n\nRainbow\n closed her eyes, to divert her feelings; both the pain and the blush \nthreatening to coarse their way across her forehead. She thought about \nTwilight and herself; how had they ended up in this situation?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, your head is all cleaned up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n opened her eyes, and looked down. The water was contaminated with red. \nRed, watered down from her blood, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look sinister, it was \nmore reminiscent of love.\nHah;\n Twilight, if only you knew, my head is far from clean, inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s as \nconvoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water. But \nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t know; you\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least she was still confident in her speech, if not in mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to help out a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s body relent for a second, a cool rush of air in place \nof where their pelts pressed together. Rainbow sighed for a second, \nrelieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking \nunder her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, \npulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head \nupon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\n Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how \nRainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her \nstomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \nseemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or\n the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,\n regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like \nthis was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,\n still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, \nand moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.\n\nShe felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.\n\nRainbow\n dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady \nherself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would \nlet her, to face Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to \nconnect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, \ntentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.\n\nRainbow\n was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her \nlavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.\n\nTwilight\n was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof\n out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and \nslowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.\nSubtle.\n\nBut definitely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.\n\nRainbow\n stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly \nruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her \neyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple\n irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a \nred bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, \nthe melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem \nall the more vivid, all the more real.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\n a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in \nits place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nTwilight\n looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her\n face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRainbow\n felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow \nweaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little \nresistance,  pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches \nbrushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.\n\nAll\n the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every \nlast detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,\n how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if\n looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, \ninto deep purple.\n\nRainbow\n took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, \npulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the \nindefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her \nwings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.\n\nRainbow\n slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon \nher. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate\n prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\nHowever,\n instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head \nover to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was \nclosing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice \nshe could;\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \ncheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting \naccident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was \naccompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was \nfine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of \nmillimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent \nkiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, \nsomething that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but \nstill almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a \nlook of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.\n\nThe\n gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words \nweren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in \nstories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short \ndistance between herself and Twilight.\n\nAgain,\n they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a \nfraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their\n mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,\n but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.\n\nRainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.\n\nRainbow\n slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join \nthe dance, to share the ecstasy.\n\nWithin\n their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in \nmere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of \nemotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of\n expressing her self further. She brought her left hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s\n mane, tracing its way up her back, as she went, stroking.\n\nThe rush of emotions was hard, for Rainbow. Although it was beautiful, it was just so\xe2\x80\xa6 Intense. She\xe2\x80\x99d only experienced emotions like that once before, during her times with that filly.\n\nWith that filly\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nA wave of guilt came over Rainbow, overcoming the new, intense emotions.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away from Twilight, prising her tongue from its lustful dance, \nbringing her hooves back in check, breaking Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and \nfinally, prolonged by Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eager leaning forwards; Rainbow broke \nthe kiss.\n\nFor\n a moment, a thin, delicate string of saliva connected the two fillies, \nglistening, only to be shattered by Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s drive to look down, into \nthe void filled by reddened water, where they once connected so \ntenderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m, so sorry,\n Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow spoke to the water, in a tiny voice. Her words were \nabsorbed, without a reply. In an even tinier, almost inaudible tone, she\n continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n got to all fours, and dripping blood-tinged water back into the bath, \nshe flapped her already-erect wings, and flew out the door; spraying red\n back into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s bemused, disconcerted eyes.\n\nShe\n found the library front door easily, and threw in open, but in her \nfrantic haste, Rainbow neglected the idea of closing it behind her.\n\nAs\n the cold night air whipped past her in the sky, chilling her sopping \nwet pelt; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less, she just repeated the same \nhysterical thoughts around in her head:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia; I\xe2\x80\x99ve betrayed them both, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been disloyal. And I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be the element of Loyalty\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*****\n\n\nThe\n bath water had long since become frigid, yet Twilight still remained in\n the reddened mixture, beginning to wrinkle, but still in the same \nposition that Rainbow had left her in. However, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t care \nthat she was cold and wrinkling, or rather, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\nShe\n was too busy desperately trying to piece together what\xe2\x80\x99d just happened.\n There had to be a reason, she knew it; things didn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.\n There was always cause and effect, as science would have her know. \nAlso, if she looked into her magic studies, she knew that Rainbow would \nnever leave like that, not if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have good reason to, she was the Element of Loyalty, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\nEven so, Twilight would have liked to have had an explanation for the whole thing.\n She\xe2\x80\x99d been enjoying her time with Rainbow, even if it was unexpected, \nshe\xe2\x80\x99d thought they were just sharing a bath out of necessity, like \nTwilight used to when she was small. She\xe2\x80\x99d been taken aback, but it \nseemed like the right thing to do, after all, she was here to learn \nabout the magic of friendship.\nTwilight\n sighed to her self, and stood up on all fours, mirroring Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nimage, and levitated the same towel that she\xe2\x80\x99d used to clear the mirror \nto her. With a sinking feeling within her stomach, Twilight thought to \nherself;\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does friendship have to be so\xe2\x80\xa6 Complicated?\xe2\x80\x9d\nTears came back to Twilight, involuntarily, delicately, leaving sorrow behind, slowly diluting the reddened water.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow\n was tired, even after just ten minutes of flying, but she attributed \nthis to the mach speed at which her brain was whirring at; not how the \nevening had taken its toll on her athletic body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal; I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she landed, Rainbow felt a small pang of bittersweet satisfaction; she\xe2\x80\x99d made it this far.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were dimming, now, out of exhaustion, but she could still focus on what she\xe2\x80\x99d come for.\n\nShe hesitantly crept forwards, towards the window she\xe2\x80\x99d come for. It was open a crack, like a small glimmer of hope.\n\nRainbow\n brought her hoof up to the window, and pushed it open, the pane of \nglass sliding silently into the dark stillness of the room. She timidly \nhauled herself over the windowsill, landing in the room with a silent \nclop.\n\nThere were shadows, all of unnatural, unnerving shapes, carved by moonlight, not dissimilar to that of Twili- Of the library\xe2\x80\x99s shadows.\n Nevertheless, Rainbow did her best to ignore them, and honed in on a \nmore toned, natural looking shadow, laid on top of what seemed to be a \nbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice was ghostly, diminished in the dead of the bedroom.\n\nShe\n sighed, with a tint of frustration; she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be louder. Rainbow \nbrought her voice up to a loud, firm, important tone, and with a hint of\n apprehension, announced:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you; Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d', 4, 30, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'4\'></a><h3>Wanting</h3>\n<p>The warmth of the water engulfed Rainbow, she could feel its swirling </p><p>encapsulate her; capture her, even more so than the vapour did.</p><p>Now?</p><p> The once warm, oppressive vapour was now like fresh air, for Rainbow. </p><p>Now it was the water that was clingy, effortlessly smothering her body, </p><p>she was in its grip.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking awfully stiff!\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight was stating the obvious for her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you lean back and relax?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Yeah, relax.

She </p><p>brushed across the cut, slowly, tentatively. It hurt, but Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t</p><p> mind; she could feel the affection Twilight was putting into her care, </p><p>and it was like anaesthesia.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> closed her eyes, to divert her feelings; both the pain and the blush </p><p>threatening to coarse their way across her forehead.

It\xe2\x80\x99s as </p><p>convoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water.

Rainbow sighed for a second, </p><p>relieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking </p><p>under her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, </p><p>pulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head </p><p>upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh,</p><p> Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how </p><p>Rainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her </p><p>stomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>seemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.&nbsp;&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or</p><p> the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,</p><p> regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like </p><p>this was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,</p><p> still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, </p><p>and moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.</p><p class="double">She felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady </p><p>herself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would </p><p>let her, to face Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to </p><p>connect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, </p><p>tentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her </p><p>lavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof</p><p> out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and </p><p>slowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">The edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p class="double">But definitely there.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly </p><p>ruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her </p><p>eyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple</p><p> irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a </p><p>red bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, </p><p>the melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem </p><p>all the more vivid, all the more real.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re</p><p> a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in </p><p>its place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her</p><p> face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow </p><p>weaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little </p><p>resistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches </p><p>brushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.</p><p class="double">All</p><p> the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every </p><p>last detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,</p><p> how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if</p><p> looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, </p><p>into deep purple.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, </p><p>pulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the </p><p>indefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her </p><p>wings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon </p><p>her. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate</p><p> prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="double">However,</p><p> instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head </p><p>over to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was </p><p>closing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice </p><p>she could;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>cheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting </p><p>accident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was </p><p>accompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was </p><p>fine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of </p><p>millimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent </p><p>kiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, </p><p>something that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but </p><p>still almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a </p><p>look of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.</p><p class="double">The</p><p> gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words </p><p>weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in </p><p>stories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short </p><p>distance between herself and Twilight.</p><p class="double">Again,</p><p> they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a </p><p>fraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their</p><p> mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,</p><p> but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join </p><p>the dance, to share the ecstasy.</p><p class="double">Within</p><p> their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in </p><p>mere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of </p><p>emotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of</p><p> expressing her self further. She brought her left hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> mane, tracing its way up her back, as she went, stroking.</p><p class="double">The rush of emotions was hard, for Rainbow. Although it was beautiful, it was just so\xe2\x80\xa6 Intense. She\xe2\x80\x99d only experienced emotions like that once before, during her times with that filly.</p><p class="double">With that filly\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">A wave of guilt came over Rainbow, overcoming the new, intense emotions.</p><p class="double">Rainbow</p><p> pulled away from Twilight, prising her tongue from its lustful dance, </p><p>bringing her hooves back in check, breaking Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and </p><p>finally, prolonged by Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eager leaning forwards; Rainbow broke </p><p>the kiss.</p><p class="double">For</p><p> a moment, a thin, delicate string of saliva connected the two fillies, </p><p>glistening, only to be shattered by Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s drive to look down, into </p><p>the void filled by reddened water, where they once connected so </p><p>tenderly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m, so sorry,</p><p> Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow spoke to the water, in a tiny voice.

Right.\nIf only she could stop thinking about the current situation. Twilight and herself, in a bath, together.\nIt was all far too exciting.\nRainbow sighed, melancholically; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let Twilight know that she was even remotely\n into fillies. Plus, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Rainbow lusted after each and every \nfilly; it was just the select couple: Twilight, and that other filly, but somehow, that made it worse.\n\nStill, she had to make it look otherwise, after all, there were reasons Rainbow hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told anypony about these feelings.\nShe had to play it cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, if you lean up against me, I can clean up your-\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice panged with a twinge of guilt. \xe2\x80\x9cInjury.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere goes that innocence again. Does Twilight not see the intimacy in that position?\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Play it cool, Dash. Play it cool.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith her newly devised internal mantra, Rainbow tentatively shifted backwards, the film of the water ever-clinging to her body.\n\nHer\n back made contact with Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s belly, its warmth sending shivers \ndown Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s spine. It was odd, warmth giving her the shivers, but she\n was more shocked at how Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s warmth differed from that of regular warmth.\nThe warmth of a living, loving pony.\nNot the warmth of a cold, inanimate object.\n\nRainbow\n laid back into Twilight, overcome with emotions, deciding that focusing\n on her mantra was more important than keeping bodily composure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good. Rainbow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I touch your forehead, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYes, right, that\xe2\x80\x99s why she was here, so Twilight could help her clean up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, it should be fine, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Great, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stuttered,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow, \xe2\x80\x98and on top of that, I accentuated her name a bit too much\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, just tell me if it hurts, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n juddered her head, ever so slightly, to show the affirmative. It was \nthe reaction that used the least amount of concentration; she needed it,\n after all. She needed it to keep on top of her mantra. She needed it to\n keep her wings down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n spoke nonchalantly, as if this was no different to a regular \nconversation. As if there was nothing that hung in the air; only \nvapours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow\n began to answer, but Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s manoeuvres caught her off guard. \nTwilight leant forwards, pushing into Rainbow, their bodies locking \ntogether, in an unintentional embrace, becoming one.\n Rainbow felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hoof; tracing along her shoulder, moving \ntowards her face, carefully brushing her mane away, to reveal her tender\n wound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, Rainbow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWow, Twilight really was clueless. It was clear from her voice; there were no quiet, husky whispers, just stark, everyday voices.\nThis made Rainbow feel a bit more at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight, I should make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n was glad she\xe2\x80\x99d managed to get the words out this time, she\xe2\x80\x99d show \nTwilight just how confident Rainbow Dash; Equestria\xe2\x80\x99s best young flier \ncould be!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, I shall look forward to seeing you there.\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still normal. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to clean your wound now, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n brought her leg up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, with flannel in hoof. She \nbrushed across the cut, slowly, tentatively. It hurt, but Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t\n mind; she could feel the affection Twilight was putting into her care, \nand it was like anaesthesia.\n\nRainbow\n closed her eyes, to divert her feelings; both the pain and the blush \nthreatening to coarse their way across her forehead. She thought about \nTwilight and herself; how had they ended up in this situation?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, your head is all cleaned up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n opened her eyes, and looked down. The water was contaminated with red. \nRed, watered down from her blood, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look sinister, it was \nmore reminiscent of love.\nHah;\n Twilight, if only you knew, my head is far from clean, inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s as \nconvoluted as the pink, swirling around in the empty, clear water. But \nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t know; you\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least she was still confident in her speech, if not in mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to help out a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s body relent for a second, a cool rush of air in place \nof where their pelts pressed together. Rainbow sighed for a second, \nrelieved, but then she felt Twilight once more, her fore-legs snaking \nunder her own, almost caressing her body, closing around her front, \npulling their bodies together once more. Twilight softly laid her head \nupon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and brought her mouth up to Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s heart was pounding; this was what it was like, that time before, with that other filly, before she\xe2\x80\x99d confessed to her. That was like her, to do something as brash as that- but not like Twilight. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like Twilight at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\n Rainbow,\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, husky, whispery. It was just how \nRainbow had imagined, not only moments ago. It sunk into her, like her \nstomach had been sinking; twisting and turning with each of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \nseemingly blas\xc3\xa9 touches.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt warmth on her shoulder, but not like the warmth of life, or\n the warmth of something inanimate. It felt cold. The cold of sorrowful,\n regretful tears. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what she\xe2\x80\x99d imagined at all. Intimacy like \nthis was supposed to be joyful, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99d learnt, anyway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could feel her compassionate sadness, against Twilight, as one, reverberating with each tear, each miniscule movement. Their bodies jolting, juddering, with each wave of emotion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just\xe2\x80\xa6 I j-j-just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you s-s-s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I have to calm her down.\xe2\x80\x99 Rainbow thought, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear her like this, to feel her like this.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwi\xe2\x80\x99, It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow put her most affirmative voice on. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it was fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow could still hear Twilight in her ear, snorting, choking on sorrow, ungainly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so s-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, just\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow was lost for words, not sure how to comfort Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n picked her legs up, from her sides, and moved her hooves to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s,\n still clinging to her. Rainbow prised them apart, exhaling slightly, \nand moved slightly forward, away from Twilight.\n\nShe felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s head leave its place on her own shoulder, and Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s hooves leave her own, withdrawing.\n\nRainbow\n dipped her forelegs back into the water, and using them to steady \nherself; she twisted around, as fast as the ever-clinging water would \nlet her, to face Twilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n sliced through the water\xe2\x80\x99s resistance with her right foreleg, to \nconnect with Twilight; hoof to hoof. Rainbow saw their hooves meet, \ntentatively yet firm, within the swirling translucent red of the water.\n\nRainbow\n was studying Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, she had a delicate air about her, her \nlavender somewhat contrasted by the blood red Rainbow had left upon her.\n\nTwilight\n was looking down into the water, dejected. Rainbow picked her left hoof\n out of the water, dripping. She brought it up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and \nslowly, ever so slightly, brought Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze up to her own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe edges of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s frown faltered, twitching into the faintest of smiles. Delicate.\nSubtle.\n\nBut definitely there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still quiet, still incurred upon with undertones of moroseness, but with a hint of affirmation.\n\nRainbow\n stroked her hoof up from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s chin to her cheek, slightly \nruffling the thin, downy pelt that coated her. Rainbow looked into her \neyes; they were coy, yet forlorn. Rainbow could see that the thin purple\n irises were not as definite as they could be, blurred by tears and a \nred bloodshot presence. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from being pretty, yes, \nthe melancholy shimmered through, but that somewhat made her eyes seem \nall the more vivid, all the more real.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\n a fantastic pony, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had left her, and in \nits place, there was careful heartfelt speech. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99re a fantastic friend. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nTwilight\n looked very pretty; there was no two ways about it. Rainbow studied her\n face a bit closer, leaning in. No, wait, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find Twilight that pretty; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into fillies. It was just something about her, something alluring.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 Thought Rainbow \xe2\x80\x98I suppose Twilight can be cool sometimes too.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRainbow\n felt her hind legs bump against Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, leaning in closer. Rainbow \nweaved her legs over Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, the water now putting up little \nresistance,  pulling their bodies closer, chest to chest, haunches \nbrushing together, then resting upon one another, diffidently.\n\nAll\n the time, Rainbow was peering upon Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s face, examining every \nlast detail; how the edges of her mouth slowly petered out into a smile,\n how her endearingly innocent dolefully joyful eyes darted around, as if\n looking for an answer, where her pink streak of mane slowly faded out, \ninto deep purple.\n\nRainbow\n took her hooves back from Twilight, and placed them around her back, \npulling them the last couple of intimate inches together; closing the \nindefinite gap of vapour between them, becoming one, once more.\n\nRainbow\n felt Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s arms join around her own back, brushing just above her \nwings. With this touch, Rainbow realised that her wings were doing that \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 again. Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, she was beyond that now, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what was cool or not. Not with Twilight, anyway.\n\nRainbow\n slowly moved her face towards Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, now seeing every detail upon \nher. She could see each hair, each impurity, every part of her intricate\n prettiness. Well, Twilight could never be just pretty, could she? She\xe2\x80\x99d even have to make that complex too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\nHowever,\n instead of continuing to move face to face, Rainbow drifted her head \nover to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s side, making a move for her ear. Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was \nclosing in, almost touching; when she adopted the huskiest tender voice \nshe could;\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you deserve so much more\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n slowly retracted her head back, brushing her lips across Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s \ncheek, for a bit longer than what could be described as a fleeting \naccident. Rainbow regained eye contact with Twilight, which was \naccompanied by another flush of warmth across her own face. This was \nfine though, she just knew Twilight would be feeling the same way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uhm\xe2\x80\xa6 Rainbow, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n was cut short, by Rainbow, leaning forwards the last couple of \nmillimetres and bridging the gap between them, in a clumsy, ineloquent \nkiss. She bashed her teeth into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, \nsomething that trivial couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the sweet couple of seconds they\xe2\x80\x99d spent connected.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away, just by a fraction, parting from Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but \nstill almost touching. As Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened, they gave way to a \nlook of confusion, which quickly subsided into longing.\n\nThe\n gaze was all the confirmation Rainbow needed; she was sure that words \nweren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at this moment in time, which was what she\xe2\x80\x99d heard in \nstories, anyway. She closed her eyes once more, and moved in the short \ndistance between herself and Twilight.\n\nAgain,\n they made contact clumsily, Rainbow missing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth by a \nfraction. She righted her mistake, (albeit enjoyable), and brought their\n mouths together. At first, their kiss was only skin-deep, lips to lips,\n but Rainbow pushed forwards, opening up, deepening.\n\nRainbow thought, as she explored with Twilight, it was as if they were closer, not only in body, but in minds.\n\nRainbow\n slowly eased her tongue forwards, in a tentative sway, dancing across \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and then onwards, coercing Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s tongue to join \nthe dance, to share the ecstasy.\n\nWithin\n their intimacy, it was really as they truly were together, not just in \nmere physicality, but within minds. Rainbow could feel a flood of \nemotions, emotions she\xe2\x80\x99d never felt before, emotions that belonged to Twilight.\n\nRainbow\n broke the ring she\xe2\x80\x99d formed around Twilight with her legs, in favour of\n expressing her self further. She brought her left hoof up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s\n mane, tracing its way up her back, as she went, stroking.\n\nThe rush of emotions was hard, for Rainbow. Although it was beautiful, it was just so\xe2\x80\xa6 Intense. She\xe2\x80\x99d only experienced emotions like that once before, during her times with that filly.\n\nWith that filly\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nA wave of guilt came over Rainbow, overcoming the new, intense emotions.\n\nRainbow\n pulled away from Twilight, prising her tongue from its lustful dance, \nbringing her hooves back in check, breaking Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and \nfinally, prolonged by Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eager leaning forwards; Rainbow broke \nthe kiss.\n\nFor\n a moment, a thin, delicate string of saliva connected the two fillies, \nglistening, only to be shattered by Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s drive to look down, into \nthe void filled by reddened water, where they once connected so \ntenderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m, so sorry,\n Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow spoke to the water, in a tiny voice. Her words were \nabsorbed, without a reply. In an even tinier, almost inaudible tone, she\n continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\n got to all fours, and dripping blood-tinged water back into the bath, \nshe flapped her already-erect wings, and flew out the door; spraying red\n back into Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s bemused, disconcerted eyes.\n\nShe\n found the library front door easily, and threw in open, but in her \nfrantic haste, Rainbow neglected the idea of closing it behind her.\n\nAs\n the cold night air whipped past her in the sky, chilling her sopping \nwet pelt; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less, she just repeated the same \nhysterical thoughts around in her head:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia; I\xe2\x80\x99ve betrayed them both, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been disloyal. And I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be the element of Loyalty\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*****\n\n\nThe\n bath water had long since become frigid, yet Twilight still remained in\n the reddened mixture, beginning to wrinkle, but still in the same \nposition that Rainbow had left her in. However, Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t care \nthat she was cold and wrinkling, or rather, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\nShe\n was too busy desperately trying to piece together what\xe2\x80\x99d just happened.\n There had to be a reason, she knew it; things didn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.\n There was always cause and effect, as science would have her know. \nAlso, if she looked into her magic studies, she knew that Rainbow would \nnever leave like that, not if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have good reason to, she was the Element of Loyalty, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\nEven so, Twilight would have liked to have had an explanation for the whole thing.\n She\xe2\x80\x99d been enjoying her time with Rainbow, even if it was unexpected, \nshe\xe2\x80\x99d thought they were just sharing a bath out of necessity, like \nTwilight used to when she was small. She\xe2\x80\x99d been taken aback, but it \nseemed like the right thing to do, after all, she was here to learn \nabout the magic of friendship.\nTwilight\n sighed to her self, and stood up on all fours, mirroring Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nimage, and levitated the same towel that she\xe2\x80\x99d used to clear the mirror \nto her. With a sinking feeling within her stomach, Twilight thought to \nherself;\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does friendship have to be so\xe2\x80\xa6 Complicated?\xe2\x80\x9d\nTears came back to Twilight, involuntarily, delicately, leaving sorrow behind, slowly diluting the reddened water.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow\n was tired, even after just ten minutes of flying, but she attributed \nthis to the mach speed at which her brain was whirring at; not how the \nevening had taken its toll on her athletic body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal; I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be loyal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she landed, Rainbow felt a small pang of bittersweet satisfaction; she\xe2\x80\x99d made it this far.\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were dimming, now, out of exhaustion, but she could still focus on what she\xe2\x80\x99d come for.\n\nShe hesitantly crept forwards, towards the window she\xe2\x80\x99d come for. It was open a crack, like a small glimmer of hope.\n\nRainbow\n brought her hoof up to the window, and pushed it open, the pane of \nglass sliding silently into the dark stillness of the room. She timidly \nhauled herself over the windowsill, landing in the room with a silent \nclop.\n\nThere were shadows, all of unnatural, unnerving shapes, carved by moonlight, not dissimilar to that of Twili- Of the library\xe2\x80\x99s shadows.\n Nevertheless, Rainbow did her best to ignore them, and honed in on a \nmore toned, natural looking shadow, laid on top of what seemed to be a \nbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice was ghostly, diminished in the dead of the bedroom.\n\nShe\n sighed, with a tint of frustration; she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be louder. Rainbow \nbrought her voice up to a loud, firm, important tone, and with a hint of\n apprehension, announced:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you; Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'epub': None}

Only aching within her legs and \nwings, it was mainly concentrated upon her head. It was as if somepony \nhad tried to dig into her brain. Even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so; it still felt \nthat way.\n\nAs much as Rainbow tried to shut it out, she could see the warm light \nthrough her eyelids; there was no way she could pretend it was still \nnight. As much as she respected Princess Celestia, Rainbow wished she \nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought the day about so soon.\n\nRainbow hauled her eyelids open, tentatively, easing her eyes into the bright \nmorning light.  She looked over at the open window, and watched the \npiercing sunlight, reflecting off of flecks of dust, swirling around, \nforming dappled, complex patterns, seemingly restless. \n\nThe ground was hard against Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s hindquarters, as she sat up, trying \nto shrug the aches off of her back. She stretched her back out, fore \nhooves reaching up to the clouds. Or rather, the ceiling.\n\nRainbow felt dizzy, for a moment, her vision slowly, but only partially leaving her for a second. Her home was made of clouds, not ceilings, windows and hard, wooden floors\xe2\x80\xa6 Where was she?\n\nShe looked around slowly, being kind to her over-sensitive eyes. The \nfloorboards looked rough, untreated. Rainbow swept her hoof across them;\n they felt rough, yet worn; devoid of splinters. \n\nThe walls were also wooden, but seemed more reassuringly smooth, but \nRainbow supposed that it could have just been to do with the fact that \nthe walls were just further away than the floor, but she decided to stop thinking of further complexities; it was the morning, after all. \n\nRainbow stretched her forelegs out once more, and decided to brave standing up.\n She grudgingly lifted her body off of the ground, and whilst arching \nher back, she spread her wings out, extending from tip to tip, cutting \nthrough the dust-laden air. Slowly, wings folding away, she clopped \ntowards the window, the window with apple-print curtains. \nRainbow realised where she was, moments before the view of the Sweet Apple \nAcres\xe2\x80\x99 apple orchard came into view.  She\xe2\x80\x99d spent the night at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do last night, Dash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stood there, for a while, letting the tiniest of breezes wash over her,\n airing her stale, matted mane. Rainbow was clearing her thoughts, or \nattempting to, at least. She let a groan out into the quiet voice of the\n wind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I just need to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n Rainbow thought. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy decision to make, after all, things \nwith Applejack were tenuous at best, and whatever had happened last \nnight, well, it probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t help their relations all that much at all. Although she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, Rainbow knew all too well what she was like after a few drinks\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nThings would probably be better after she\xe2\x80\x99d mulled them over a bit, and Rainbow really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drum up any awkward conversation between herself and Applejack; she had problem enough thinking about that sort of stuff, let alone talking. \n\nRainbow pushed against the window\xe2\x80\x99s frame, exposing herself to the fullness of \nthe farm\xe2\x80\x99s calm breeze. It came with a slight fragrance of apple, \nreminiscent of days long past, napping in trees, casual chats about \nnothing with Applejack, thinking to the future. It\xe2\x80\x99d been a while since \none of those chats; they\xe2\x80\x99d stopped as soon as Rainbow had deemed them \xe2\x80\x98Too embarrassing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, what\xe2\x80\x99d they replaced these times with? \nStunted, difficult words, exchanged in fleeted meetings. Just because of one night. \n\nMaybe that was one other thing Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control: Friendship.\n\nRainbow moved her fore hooves up onto the windowsill, ready to take off, out of\n the window, but the papery feel beneath her right hoof made her think \notherwise. She looked down at the paper, and lifted her hoof up. Folded,\n it was adorned with \xe2\x80\x98Dash\xe2\x80\x99, in scruffy, yet attemptedly careful \nwriting.\n\nRainbow felt her stomach twist, she knew whose hoofwriting this was, and with \nwhat premise it was probably written after, yet still, she unfolded the \nletter as quickly as possible. After all, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to not \nknow.\n\nDash,\n\nI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d try to climb out the window, and pretend like nothing \nhappened, but I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping a loyal pony like yourself would realise that \ntheir friend needs them, and change their mind?\nWe really need to talk, but y\xe2\x80\x99know, like a proper talk. Not an \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s 3AM, \nI\xe2\x80\x99m really drunk and decided to break into Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be out applebucking; I\xe2\x80\x99m on a tight schedule, but come and talk to me. I can always take time out to see you.\n\nYou really did say do some interesting things last night. \n\n-That \xe2\x80\x98Other\xe2\x80\x99 Filly\n\n(Thanks for the new nickname, by the way\xe2\x80\xa6) \n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a cooling breeze, Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve probably burned up and melted, right on the spot.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6light?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the uncouth awakening of having her own name shouted in her ear, it was\n obvious Twilight was going to be unhappy, but surprisingly, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\n what had garnered the most of her early-morning contempt. What had been\n bestowed with that award was, in fact, the overall wet, ice-cold \nfeeling that surrounded her body. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why were you sleeping in the bathtub?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout opening her eyes, Twilight responded, groggily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, Spike, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a bit cold, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Now, if you just pass me my blanket, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to sleep\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99? Don\xe2\x80\x99t go all \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99 on me; you\xe2\x80\x99re definitely in the bathtub.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight opened her eyes, and was met with a slightly pink-stained white, taking up her peripheries. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was most definitely in the bathtub, she knew that much. However, \nfurther from that, she knew nothing. She remembered walking home, after a\n night out with Rainbow Dash, and then\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pony braced herself, and then put what seemed like far, far\n too much effort into lifting her body out of the chilled, pink-y \nconcoction. Although despising the effort put into the task of standing \nup, Twilight still took it upon herself to shake the blood infused water\n across the bathroom, and across her assistant, Spike.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh, Twilight! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been soaking in that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNevertheless, Twilight, now dry, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed about her assistant\xe2\x80\x99s wellbeing. She had other things on her mind, other fillies\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rainbow\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you mean Spike, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight felt a light blush across herself; she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said that out loud, had she?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Spike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Twilight tried to speak with an air of authority, but her voice was \nfailing, under assault from the memories from the previous night. Well, \nthe ones she could still remember.\n\nTwilight stepped out of the bathtub, onto the well-streaked tiles of the floor. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, you know how you\xe2\x80\x99re my number one assistant?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike groaned; he knew what was coming next.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll clean the bathroom for you.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nTwilight could hear the dejectedness in Spike\xe2\x80\x99s voice, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too \nfussed, she knew he\xe2\x80\x99d bounce back. After all, he really was a fantastic \nassistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks Spike!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight spun around on the spot, turning to face the doorway. As she lifted her\n hooves, she left pale red marks upon the tiles, adding colour to the \nonce labyrinthine lines traced, the night before. \n\nTwilight could think clearly, now. There was colour to her thoughts, and colour on her mind.\n\nAs she walked out into the library, everything looked a little brighter. \nThe shelves, once imposing, stifling the library with their books, no \nlonger seemed to oppress, to demand silence. Now, they stood for \npossibilities, for opportunities, each one different. However, none of \nthe hundreds of possibilities that surrounded Twilight could have been \nanywhere near negative. \nLife was just too fantastic.\n\nAs a breeze swept in, through an open window, Twilight thought to herself; about friends, about friendship, about Rainbow Dash. \n\nShe wondered, \xe2\x80\x98All this time, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying friendship, and nothing has ever felt quite this fantastic. Is this true friendship?\xe2\x80\x99 \n\nEven though Rainbow had left her during the night, Twilight was sure she\xe2\x80\x99d \nhad an important reason, after all, she was the most loyal pony in all \nof Equestria, and more importantly; she was her friend, and Twilight believed in her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see you; we have so much to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe view across the apple orchard was beautiful, from on top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s\n old hill. It was good for thinking, and for reminiscing, after all, it \nheld a lot of memories, for Applejack, at least.\n\nLost in the scent of freshly bucked trees, and their bruised bark, \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind began to drift, to the thoughts that lay within her. \nThey\xe2\x80\x99d happened so long ago, and yet, they seemed so vivid; almost \npelt-deep.\n\nEven though Granny Smith had told her otherwise, so many times, she\xe2\x80\x99d taken \nshelter under Bloomberg, during a sudden thunderstorm. It was odd; \ngetting caught in such rainstorms was commonplace, for somepony that \nworks on a farm, but for some reason, Applejack felt bothered by it.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why, despite the amount of times she\xe2\x80\x99d been through \nthe events in her head. In the end, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, these \nthings weren\xe2\x80\x99t really the reason Applejack constantly replayed these \nmemories.\n\nIt was: when a dripping wet rainbow fell from the skies, streaked with tears, shaking, sobbing.\n\n\n Applejack had said nothing to the poor filly; they just sat, in a \ntrembling, yet compassionate embrace, nuzzling, tears soaking into her \nback. It was Dash who\xe2\x80\x99d done the talking, but it was nothing like Dash\xe2\x80\x99s\n usual, cocky speech. It was so very real.\n\nReal problems, real thoughts, real feelings.\n\nApplejack had been fine, up until that point. She liked that Dash could trust \nher, depend on her, after all the years of their banter-esqe \nrelationship. She\xe2\x80\x99d finally opened up,\n and Applejack was glad for that. Of all ponies, Applejack knew better \nthan to handle things by herself, but there was no telling Dash that. It\n was a good thing she\xe2\x80\x99d come to that conclusion herself.\n\nStill, as strong as Applejack tried to be for Dash, the next thing she said had caught her off guard. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven looking back on it, Applejack felt embarrassed. However, that feeling was always overwhelmed by another, every time. \n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOverwhelmed by confusion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I l\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConfusion, tinged with sadness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack felt the trio of emotions inundate her, as if she was reliving the memory, of that rainy eve, on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99d yew have ta go and puzzle me so, Dash? You toying with me or something?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack frowned through her sad, embarrassed confusion. One minute Dash was \nfighting with her, over even the most trivial things, the next? Dash \nwould be on top of her, crying into her arms once more, as if they never\n argued, as if all Applejack were was just a friendly face in the dark, somewhere to dump her emotions.\n\nApplejack sighed, and thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what y\xe2\x80\x99all get for being the most dependable pony in Ponyville, huh?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like flying. Her heart wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it. \n\nIt was elsewhere, occupied, gone.\n Rainbow Dash slowly trotted up in-between the rows of carefully planted\n apple trees, towards where she thought it lay; in the hooves of that other filly, at the top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\nRainbow shook her head, a desperate attempt to try to understand what was \nhappening. Everything she had, everything she\xe2\x80\x99d made, albeit \naccidentally, was falling apart. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d been fantastic, even if it had only been a choice few evenings, shrouded in rain, teary-eyed.\n\nIf only she had another reason to spend time like that with her. Nopony else could know, after all, Dash had to be cool.\n\nRainbow gulped, and continued her slow, pained walk, up to Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, two thoughts reverberating around her mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I have to be cool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n', 'chapter_number': 5, 'parent_chapter_id': 41, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'5\'></a><h3>Mechanisms</h3>\n<p>Rainbow felt pain, coursing through her body.

There was colour to her thoughts, and colour on her mind.</p><p class="double">As she walked out into the library, everything looked a little brighter. </p><p>The shelves, once imposing, stifling the library with their books, no </p><p>longer seemed to oppress, to demand silence. Now, they stood for </p><p>possibilities, for opportunities, each one different. However, none of </p><p>the hundreds of possibilities that surrounded Twilight could have been </p><p>anywhere near negative. </p><p>Life was just too fantastic.</p><p class="double">As a breeze swept in, through an open window, Twilight thought to herself; about friends, about friendship, about Rainbow Dash. </p><p class="double">She wondered, \xe2\x80\x98All this time, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying friendship, and nothing has ever felt quite this fantastic. Is this true friendship?\xe2\x80\x99 </p><p class="double">Even though Rainbow had left her during the night, Twilight was sure she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>had an important reason, after all, she was the most loyal pony in all </p><p>of Equestria, and more importantly; she was her friend, and Twilight believed in her.</p><p class="double"> \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see you; we have so much to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>The view across the apple orchard was beautiful, from on top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> old hill. It was good for thinking, and for reminiscing, after all, it </p><p>held a lot of memories, for Applejack, at least.</p><p class="double">Lost in the scent of freshly bucked trees, and their bruised bark, </p><p>Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind began to drift, to the thoughts that lay within her. </p><p>They\xe2\x80\x99d happened so long ago, and yet, they seemed so vivid; almost </p><p>pelt-deep.</p><p class="double">Even though Granny Smith had told her otherwise, so many times, she\xe2\x80\x99d taken </p><p>shelter under Bloomberg, during a sudden thunderstorm. It was odd; </p><p>getting caught in such rainstorms was commonplace, for somepony that </p><p>works on a farm, but for some reason, Applejack felt bothered by it.</p><p class="double">She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why, despite the amount of times she\xe2\x80\x99d been through </p><p>the events in her head. In the end, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, these </p><p>things weren\xe2\x80\x99t really the reason Applejack constantly replayed these </p><p>memories.</p><p class="double">It was: when a dripping wet rainbow fell from the skies, streaked with tears, shaking, sobbing.</p><p class="double"></p><p> Applejack had said nothing to the poor filly; they just sat, in a </p><p>trembling, yet compassionate embrace, nuzzling, tears soaking into her </p><p>back. It was Dash who\xe2\x80\x99d done the talking, but it was nothing like Dash\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> usual, cocky speech. It was so very real.</p><p class="double">Real problems, real thoughts, real feelings.</p><p class="double">Applejack had been fine, up until that point. She liked that Dash could trust </p><p>her, depend on her, after all the years of their banter-esqe </p><p>relationship. She\xe2\x80\x99d finally opened up,</p><p> and Applejack was glad for that. Of all ponies, Applejack knew better </p><p>than to handle things by herself, but there was no telling Dash that. It</p><p> was a good thing she\xe2\x80\x99d come to that conclusion herself.</p><p class="double">Still, as strong as Applejack tried to be for Dash, the next thing she said had caught her off guard. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Even looking back on it, Applejack felt embarrassed. However, that feeling was always overwhelmed by another, every time. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Overwhelmed by confusion.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI think I l\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Confusion, tinged with sadness.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cLove you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack felt the trio of emotions inundate her, as if she was reliving the memory, of that rainy eve, on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99d yew have ta go and puzzle me so, Dash? You toying with me or something?\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="double">Applejack frowned through her sad, embarrassed confusion. One minute Dash was </p><p>fighting with her, over even the most trivial things, the next? Dash </p><p>would be on top of her, crying into her arms once more, as if they never</p><p> argued, as if all Applejack were was just a friendly face in the dark, somewhere to dump her emotions.</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed, and thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what y\xe2\x80\x99all get for being the most dependable pony in Ponyville, huh?\xe2\x80\x99</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like flying.

Only aching within her legs and </p><p>wings, it was mainly concentrated upon her head. It was as if somepony </p><p>had tried to dig into her brain. Even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so; it still felt </p><p>that way.</p><p class="double">As much as Rainbow tried to shut it out, she could see the warm light </p><p>through her eyelids; there was no way she could pretend it was still </p><p>night. As much as she respected Princess Celestia, Rainbow wished she </p><p>hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought the day about so soon.</p><p class="double">Rainbow hauled her eyelids open, tentatively, easing her eyes into the bright </p><p>morning light.&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked over at the open window, and watched the </p><p>piercing sunlight, reflecting off of flecks of dust, swirling around, </p><p>forming dappled, complex patterns, seemingly restless. </p><p class="double">The ground was hard against Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s hindquarters, as she sat up, trying </p><p>to shrug the aches off of her back. She stretched her back out, fore </p><p>hooves reaching up to the clouds. Or rather, the ceiling.</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt dizzy, for a moment, her vision slowly, but only partially leaving her for a second. Her home was made of clouds, not ceilings, windows and hard, wooden floors\xe2\x80\xa6 Where was she?</p><p class="double">She looked around slowly, being kind to her over-sensitive eyes. The </p><p>floorboards looked rough, untreated. Rainbow swept her hoof across them;</p><p> they felt rough, yet worn; devoid of splinters. </p><p class="double">The walls were also wooden, but seemed more reassuringly smooth, but </p><p>Rainbow supposed that it could have just been to do with the fact that </p><p>the walls were just further away than the floor, but she decided to stop thinking of further complexities; it was the morning, after all. </p><p class="double">Rainbow stretched her forelegs out once more, and decided to brave standing up.</p><p> She grudgingly lifted her body off of the ground, and whilst arching </p><p>her back, she spread her wings out, extending from tip to tip, cutting </p><p>through the dust-laden air. Slowly, wings folding away, she clopped </p><p>towards the window, the window with apple-print curtains. </p><p>Rainbow realised where she was, moments before the view of the Sweet Apple </p><p>Acres\xe2\x80\x99 apple orchard came into view.&nbsp;&nbsp;She\xe2\x80\x99d spent the night at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do last night, Dash?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow stood there, for a while, letting the tiniest of breezes wash over her,</p><p> airing her stale, matted mane. Rainbow was clearing her thoughts, or </p><p>attempting to, at least. She let a groan out into the quiet voice of the</p><p> wind.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x98I think I just need to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99</p><p> Rainbow thought. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy decision to make, after all, things </p><p>with Applejack were tenuous at best, and whatever had happened last </p><p>night, well, it probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t help their relations all that much at all. Although she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, Rainbow knew all too well what she was like after a few drinks\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="double">Things would probably be better after she\xe2\x80\x99d mulled them over a bit, and Rainbow really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drum up any awkward conversation between herself and Applejack; she had problem enough thinking about that sort of stuff, let alone talking. </p><p class="double">Rainbow pushed against the window\xe2\x80\x99s frame, exposing herself to the fullness of </p><p>the farm\xe2\x80\x99s calm breeze. It came with a slight fragrance of apple, </p><p>reminiscent of days long past, napping in trees, casual chats about </p><p>nothing with Applejack, thinking to the future. It\xe2\x80\x99d been a while since </p><p>one of those chats; they\xe2\x80\x99d stopped as soon as Rainbow had deemed them \xe2\x80\x98Too embarrassing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, what\xe2\x80\x99d they replaced these times with? </p><p>Stunted, difficult words, exchanged in fleeted meetings. Just because of one night. </p><p class="double">Maybe that was one other thing Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control: Friendship.</p><p class="double">Rainbow moved her fore hooves up onto the windowsill, ready to take off, out of</p><p> the window, but the papery feel beneath her right hoof made her think </p><p>otherwise. She looked down at the paper, and lifted her hoof up. Folded,</p><p> it was adorned with \xe2\x80\x98Dash\xe2\x80\x99, in scruffy, yet attemptedly careful </p><p>writing.</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt her stomach twist, she knew whose hoofwriting this was, and with </p><p>what premise it was probably written after, yet still, she unfolded the </p><p>letter as quickly as possible.

Only aching within her legs and \nwings, it was mainly concentrated upon her head. It was as if somepony \nhad tried to dig into her brain. Even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so; it still felt \nthat way.\n\nAs much as Rainbow tried to shut it out, she could see the warm light \nthrough her eyelids; there was no way she could pretend it was still \nnight. As much as she respected Princess Celestia, Rainbow wished she \nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought the day about so soon.\n\nRainbow hauled her eyelids open, tentatively, easing her eyes into the bright \nmorning light.  She looked over at the open window, and watched the \npiercing sunlight, reflecting off of flecks of dust, swirling around, \nforming dappled, complex patterns, seemingly restless. \n\nThe ground was hard against Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s hindquarters, as she sat up, trying \nto shrug the aches off of her back. She stretched her back out, fore \nhooves reaching up to the clouds. Or rather, the ceiling.\n\nRainbow felt dizzy, for a moment, her vision slowly, but only partially leaving her for a second. Her home was made of clouds, not ceilings, windows and hard, wooden floors\xe2\x80\xa6 Where was she?\n\nShe looked around slowly, being kind to her over-sensitive eyes. The \nfloorboards looked rough, untreated. Rainbow swept her hoof across them;\n they felt rough, yet worn; devoid of splinters. \n\nThe walls were also wooden, but seemed more reassuringly smooth, but \nRainbow supposed that it could have just been to do with the fact that \nthe walls were just further away than the floor, but she decided to stop thinking of further complexities; it was the morning, after all. \n\nRainbow stretched her forelegs out once more, and decided to brave standing up.\n She grudgingly lifted her body off of the ground, and whilst arching \nher back, she spread her wings out, extending from tip to tip, cutting \nthrough the dust-laden air. Slowly, wings folding away, she clopped \ntowards the window, the window with apple-print curtains. \nRainbow realised where she was, moments before the view of the Sweet Apple \nAcres\xe2\x80\x99 apple orchard came into view.  She\xe2\x80\x99d spent the night at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do last night, Dash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stood there, for a while, letting the tiniest of breezes wash over her,\n airing her stale, matted mane. Rainbow was clearing her thoughts, or \nattempting to, at least. She let a groan out into the quiet voice of the\n wind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I just need to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n Rainbow thought. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy decision to make, after all, things \nwith Applejack were tenuous at best, and whatever had happened last \nnight, well, it probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t help their relations all that much at all. Although she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, Rainbow knew all too well what she was like after a few drinks\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nThings would probably be better after she\xe2\x80\x99d mulled them over a bit, and Rainbow really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drum up any awkward conversation between herself and Applejack; she had problem enough thinking about that sort of stuff, let alone talking. \n\nRainbow pushed against the window\xe2\x80\x99s frame, exposing herself to the fullness of \nthe farm\xe2\x80\x99s calm breeze. It came with a slight fragrance of apple, \nreminiscent of days long past, napping in trees, casual chats about \nnothing with Applejack, thinking to the future. It\xe2\x80\x99d been a while since \none of those chats; they\xe2\x80\x99d stopped as soon as Rainbow had deemed them \xe2\x80\x98Too embarrassing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, what\xe2\x80\x99d they replaced these times with? \nStunted, difficult words, exchanged in fleeted meetings. Just because of one night. \n\nMaybe that was one other thing Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control: Friendship.\n\nRainbow moved her fore hooves up onto the windowsill, ready to take off, out of\n the window, but the papery feel beneath her right hoof made her think \notherwise. She looked down at the paper, and lifted her hoof up. Folded,\n it was adorned with \xe2\x80\x98Dash\xe2\x80\x99, in scruffy, yet attemptedly careful \nwriting.\n\nRainbow felt her stomach twist, she knew whose hoofwriting this was, and with \nwhat premise it was probably written after, yet still, she unfolded the \nletter as quickly as possible. After all, Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to not \nknow.\n\nDash,\n\nI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d try to climb out the window, and pretend like nothing \nhappened, but I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping a loyal pony like yourself would realise that \ntheir friend needs them, and change their mind?\nWe really need to talk, but y\xe2\x80\x99know, like a proper talk. Not an \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s 3AM, \nI\xe2\x80\x99m really drunk and decided to break into Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be out applebucking; I\xe2\x80\x99m on a tight schedule, but come and talk to me. I can always take time out to see you.\n\nYou really did say do some interesting things last night. \n\n-That \xe2\x80\x98Other\xe2\x80\x99 Filly\n\n(Thanks for the new nickname, by the way\xe2\x80\xa6) \n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a cooling breeze, Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve probably burned up and melted, right on the spot.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6light?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the uncouth awakening of having her own name shouted in her ear, it was\n obvious Twilight was going to be unhappy, but surprisingly, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\n what had garnered the most of her early-morning contempt. What had been\n bestowed with that award was, in fact, the overall wet, ice-cold \nfeeling that surrounded her body. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why were you sleeping in the bathtub?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout opening her eyes, Twilight responded, groggily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, Spike, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a bit cold, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Now, if you just pass me my blanket, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to sleep\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhh, Twi\xe2\x80\x99? Don\xe2\x80\x99t go all \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99 on me; you\xe2\x80\x99re definitely in the bathtub.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight opened her eyes, and was met with a slightly pink-stained white, taking up her peripheries. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight was most definitely in the bathtub, she knew that much. However, \nfurther from that, she knew nothing. She remembered walking home, after a\n night out with Rainbow Dash, and then\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pony braced herself, and then put what seemed like far, far\n too much effort into lifting her body out of the chilled, pink-y \nconcoction. Although despising the effort put into the task of standing \nup, Twilight still took it upon herself to shake the blood infused water\n across the bathroom, and across her assistant, Spike.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh, Twilight! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been soaking in that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNevertheless, Twilight, now dry, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed about her assistant\xe2\x80\x99s wellbeing. She had other things on her mind, other fillies\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rainbow\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, you mean Spike, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight felt a light blush across herself; she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said that out loud, had she?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Spike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n Twilight tried to speak with an air of authority, but her voice was \nfailing, under assault from the memories from the previous night. Well, \nthe ones she could still remember.\n\nTwilight stepped out of the bathtub, onto the well-streaked tiles of the floor. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, you know how you\xe2\x80\x99re my number one assistant?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike groaned; he knew what was coming next.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll clean the bathroom for you.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nTwilight could hear the dejectedness in Spike\xe2\x80\x99s voice, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too \nfussed, she knew he\xe2\x80\x99d bounce back. After all, he really was a fantastic \nassistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks Spike!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight spun around on the spot, turning to face the doorway. As she lifted her\n hooves, she left pale red marks upon the tiles, adding colour to the \nonce labyrinthine lines traced, the night before. \n\nTwilight could think clearly, now. There was colour to her thoughts, and colour on her mind.\n\nAs she walked out into the library, everything looked a little brighter. \nThe shelves, once imposing, stifling the library with their books, no \nlonger seemed to oppress, to demand silence. Now, they stood for \npossibilities, for opportunities, each one different. However, none of \nthe hundreds of possibilities that surrounded Twilight could have been \nanywhere near negative. \nLife was just too fantastic.\n\nAs a breeze swept in, through an open window, Twilight thought to herself; about friends, about friendship, about Rainbow Dash. \n\nShe wondered, \xe2\x80\x98All this time, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying friendship, and nothing has ever felt quite this fantastic. Is this true friendship?\xe2\x80\x99 \n\nEven though Rainbow had left her during the night, Twilight was sure she\xe2\x80\x99d \nhad an important reason, after all, she was the most loyal pony in all \nof Equestria, and more importantly; she was her friend, and Twilight believed in her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see you; we have so much to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe view across the apple orchard was beautiful, from on top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s\n old hill. It was good for thinking, and for reminiscing, after all, it \nheld a lot of memories, for Applejack, at least.\n\nLost in the scent of freshly bucked trees, and their bruised bark, \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind began to drift, to the thoughts that lay within her. \nThey\xe2\x80\x99d happened so long ago, and yet, they seemed so vivid; almost \npelt-deep.\n\nEven though Granny Smith had told her otherwise, so many times, she\xe2\x80\x99d taken \nshelter under Bloomberg, during a sudden thunderstorm. It was odd; \ngetting caught in such rainstorms was commonplace, for somepony that \nworks on a farm, but for some reason, Applejack felt bothered by it.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why, despite the amount of times she\xe2\x80\x99d been through \nthe events in her head. In the end, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, these \nthings weren\xe2\x80\x99t really the reason Applejack constantly replayed these \nmemories.\n\nIt was: when a dripping wet rainbow fell from the skies, streaked with tears, shaking, sobbing.\n\n\n Applejack had said nothing to the poor filly; they just sat, in a \ntrembling, yet compassionate embrace, nuzzling, tears soaking into her \nback. It was Dash who\xe2\x80\x99d done the talking, but it was nothing like Dash\xe2\x80\x99s\n usual, cocky speech. It was so very real.\n\nReal problems, real thoughts, real feelings.\n\nApplejack had been fine, up until that point. She liked that Dash could trust \nher, depend on her, after all the years of their banter-esqe \nrelationship. She\xe2\x80\x99d finally opened up,\n and Applejack was glad for that. Of all ponies, Applejack knew better \nthan to handle things by herself, but there was no telling Dash that.

However, that feeling was always overwhelmed by another, every time. \n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOverwhelmed by confusion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I l\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConfusion, tinged with sadness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack felt the trio of emotions inundate her, as if she was reliving the memory, of that rainy eve, on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99d yew have ta go and puzzle me so, Dash? You toying with me or something?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack frowned through her sad, embarrassed confusion. One minute Dash was \nfighting with her, over even the most trivial things, the next? Dash \nwould be on top of her, crying into her arms once more, as if they never\n argued, as if all Applejack were was just a friendly face in the dark, somewhere to dump her emotions.\n\nApplejack sighed, and thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what y\xe2\x80\x99all get for being the most dependable pony in Ponyville, huh?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like flying. Her heart wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it. \n\nIt was elsewhere, occupied, gone.\n Rainbow Dash slowly trotted up in-between the rows of carefully planted\n apple trees, towards where she thought it lay; in the hooves of that other filly, at the top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\nRainbow shook her head, a desperate attempt to try to understand what was \nhappening. Everything she had, everything she\xe2\x80\x99d made, albeit \naccidentally, was falling apart. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d been fantastic, even if it had only been a choice few evenings, shrouded in rain, teary-eyed.\n\nIf only she had another reason to spend time like that with her.

It was Dash who\xe2\x80\x99d done the talking, but it was nothing like Dash\xe2\x80\x99s</p><p> usual, cocky speech. It was so very real.</p><p class="double">Real problems, real thoughts, real feelings.</p><p class="double">Applejack had been fine, up until that point.

Only aching within her legs and \nwings, it was mainly concentrated upon her head. It was as if somepony \nhad tried to dig into her brain. Even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so; it still felt \nthat way.\n\nAs much as Rainbow tried to shut it out, she could see the warm light \nthrough her eyelids; there was no way she could pretend it was still \nnight. As much as she respected Princess Celestia, Rainbow wished she \nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought the day about so soon.\n\nRainbow hauled her eyelids open, tentatively, easing her eyes into the bright \nmorning light.  She looked over at the open window, and watched the \npiercing sunlight, reflecting off of flecks of dust, swirling around, \nforming dappled, complex patterns, seemingly restless. \n\nThe ground was hard against Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s hindquarters, as she sat up, trying \nto shrug the aches off of her back. She stretched her back out, fore \nhooves reaching up to the clouds. Or rather, the ceiling.\n\nRainbow felt dizzy, for a moment, her vision slowly, but only partially leaving her for a second. Her home was made of clouds, not ceilings, windows and hard, wooden floors\xe2\x80\xa6 Where was she?\n\nShe looked around slowly, being kind to her over-sensitive eyes. The \nfloorboards looked rough, untreated. Rainbow swept her hoof across them;\n they felt rough, yet worn; devoid of splinters. \n\nThe walls were also wooden, but seemed more reassuringly smooth, but \nRainbow supposed that it could have just been to do with the fact that \nthe walls were just further away than the floor, but she decided to stop thinking of further complexities; it was the morning, after all. \n\nRainbow stretched her forelegs out once more, and decided to brave standing up.\n She grudgingly lifted her body off of the ground, and whilst arching \nher back, she spread her wings out, extending from tip to tip, cutting \nthrough the dust-laden air. Slowly, wings folding away, she clopped \ntowards the window, the window with apple-print curtains. \nRainbow realised where she was, moments before the view of the Sweet Apple \nAcres\xe2\x80\x99 apple orchard came into view.  She\xe2\x80\x99d spent the night at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Rainbow groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do last night, Dash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stood there, for a while, letting the tiniest of breezes wash over her,\n airing her stale, matted mane. Rainbow was clearing her thoughts, or \nattempting to, at least. She let a groan out into the quiet voice of the\n wind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I just need to go\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n Rainbow thought. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy decision to make, after all, things \nwith Applejack were tenuous at best, and whatever had happened last \nnight, well, it probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t help their relations all that much at all.

However, none of \nthe hundreds of possibilities that surrounded Twilight could have been \nanywhere near negative. \nLife was just too fantastic.\n\nAs a breeze swept in, through an open window, Twilight thought to herself; about friends, about friendship, about Rainbow Dash. \n\nShe wondered, \xe2\x80\x98All this time, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying friendship, and nothing has ever felt quite this fantastic. Is this true friendship?\xe2\x80\x99 \n\nEven though Rainbow had left her during the night, Twilight was sure she\xe2\x80\x99d \nhad an important reason, after all, she was the most loyal pony in all \nof Equestria, and more importantly; she was her friend, and Twilight believed in her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRainbow, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see you; we have so much to talk about\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe view across the apple orchard was beautiful, from on top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s\n old hill. It was good for thinking, and for reminiscing, after all, it \nheld a lot of memories, for Applejack, at least.\n\nLost in the scent of freshly bucked trees, and their bruised bark, \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind began to drift, to the thoughts that lay within her. \nThey\xe2\x80\x99d happened so long ago, and yet, they seemed so vivid; almost \npelt-deep.\n\nEven though Granny Smith had told her otherwise, so many times, she\xe2\x80\x99d taken \nshelter under Bloomberg, during a sudden thunderstorm. It was odd; \ngetting caught in such rainstorms was commonplace, for somepony that \nworks on a farm, but for some reason, Applejack felt bothered by it.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure why, despite the amount of times she\xe2\x80\x99d been through \nthe events in her head. In the end, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, these \nthings weren\xe2\x80\x99t really the reason Applejack constantly replayed these \nmemories.\n\nIt was: when a dripping wet rainbow fell from the skies, streaked with tears, shaking, sobbing.\n\n\n Applejack had said nothing to the poor filly; they just sat, in a \ntrembling, yet compassionate embrace, nuzzling, tears soaking into her \nback. It was Dash who\xe2\x80\x99d done the talking, but it was nothing like Dash\xe2\x80\x99s\n usual, cocky speech. It was so very real.\n\nReal problems, real thoughts, real feelings.\n\nApplejack had been fine, up until that point. She liked that Dash could trust \nher, depend on her, after all the years of their banter-esqe \nrelationship. She\xe2\x80\x99d finally opened up,\n and Applejack was glad for that. Of all ponies, Applejack knew better \nthan to handle things by herself, but there was no telling Dash that. It\n was a good thing she\xe2\x80\x99d come to that conclusion herself.\n\nStill, as strong as Applejack tried to be for Dash, the next thing she said had caught her off guard. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven looking back on it, Applejack felt embarrassed. However, that feeling was always overwhelmed by another, every time. \n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOverwhelmed by confusion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I l\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConfusion, tinged with sadness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack felt the trio of emotions inundate her, as if she was reliving the memory, of that rainy eve, on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99d yew have ta go and puzzle me so, Dash? You toying with me or something?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack frowned through her sad, embarrassed confusion. One minute Dash was \nfighting with her, over even the most trivial things, the next? Dash \nwould be on top of her, crying into her arms once more, as if they never\n argued, as if all Applejack were was just a friendly face in the dark, somewhere to dump her emotions.\n\nApplejack sighed, and thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what y\xe2\x80\x99all get for being the most dependable pony in Ponyville, huh?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like flying. Her heart wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it. \n\nIt was elsewhere, occupied, gone.\n Rainbow Dash slowly trotted up in-between the rows of carefully planted\n apple trees, towards where she thought it lay; in the hooves of that other filly, at the top of Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\nRainbow shook her head, a desperate attempt to try to understand what was \nhappening. Everything she had, everything she\xe2\x80\x99d made, albeit \naccidentally, was falling apart. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d been fantastic, even if it had only been a choice few evenings, shrouded in rain, teary-eyed.\n\nIf only she had another reason to spend time like that with her. Nopony else could know, after all, Dash had to be cool.\n\nRainbow gulped, and continued her slow, pained walk, up to Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, two thoughts reverberating around her mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I have to be cool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n', 'epub': None}

With each tree she passed, her mind wandered more and more \ntowards Applejack, and what Rainbow had said to her. \nNot that Rainbow really remembered.\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s letter had jogged her memory a tad, and the wound upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head \nhad helped it on its way, but it still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all there.\n\nShe remembered about Twilight and herself, almost begrudgingly. However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t remembering the events that jarred Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mind so. It was her own thoughts and feelings. \nThoughts and feelings that nopony could really synthesise, even in \nretrospect. They were very much real.\n\nFrom Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s experience, she only knew these feelings from a tiny amount \nof night encounters before, but all from the same place.\n\nA place which now, seemed only to be foreshadowed with doubt, despite its open, airy atmosphere.\n\nBloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nTwilight was sprawled out on her sofa, happy, merely through just existing. She \nexhaled, in a long sigh, finally relaxed after her night on cold enamel \nand water.\n\nOn breathing back in, Twilight noticed a slight odour. One that was \nsomewhat familiar, yet alien, to the library at least. She moved her \ngaze down, and against the white fabric of the sofa, Twilight saw faint,\n pale fibres. Curiously, Twilight brought her head down to the fabric, \nand gave it a quick, speculative sniff. \nTwilight knew that was quite unscientific, and could be considered as odd,\n but in the situation, she\xe2\x80\x99d decided it was the right thing to do. \nBesides, nopony was in the library with her, so nopony else would know \nto be able to call it odd. Not that she would have minded, anyway.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, Twilight realised what was so familiar about the \nscent, after all, she\xe2\x80\x99d spent a good part of the night before engulfed \nin it. The scent had caressed her, surrounded her and been with her.\n\nTwilight lightly pushed her face into the sofa\xe2\x80\x99s cushions, and inhaled as deeply\n as she could, swimming in the memories of Rainbow and herself. Yet, as \nshe was deepest in thought, she involuntarily broke down into a fit of \nchildish giggles. \n\xe2\x80\x98Wow, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99 she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98That really was odd\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRegardless, Twilight just immersed herself in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent once more. She\xe2\x80\x99d \noften wondered why everypony in romance novels did things like this; \njust sitting, thinking about their loved ones, inhaling their scent. \n\nNow, though, things were different.\n\nPerhaps, like in those books, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t odd, but she was in love.\n\nTwilight inhaled another gasp of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent, and filled her thoughts with \nthe pegasus. Nopony had ever quite shone in this sort of light to \nTwilight before, and so, she intended to make the most of it.\nAfter all, it felt good.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nApplejack had been laid out on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill for quite some time now, \nexasperated. Not that she minded the location, but she really had to get\n back to work on the farm.  She was the most dependable pony in Ponyville, and knew she really should get back to bucking, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing anything.\n\nNot out of laziness, Applejack was far from lazy, and she knew it; but somehow, that made it worse.\nHowever, her disdain for it did nothing to counteract it. The one thing that \ngave Applejack solace was that at least she knew what was causing her \nlistlessness.\n\nLight hoof-fall began to puncture the murmuring soundscape of rustling leaves\n and light breeze, and with each muffled clop, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts \nbegan to run amok. She was painting situations in her head, some more \nbrash, whilst others were tenderer.\n\nApplejack knew it was silly, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop acting the scenes out in the safety of her own mind.\nShe could get the words just right in there.\n\nThere was a modest sound of setting down, beside her, and Applejack, still with her eyes firmly closed, knew who was there.\n\nShe heard a sigh. Not one of exasperation, but a long, drawn out sigh of relief. Applejack found it reassuring.\n\nShe laid there, basking in the sunlight, alongside her counterpart, just \ndoing nothing, just revelling in her company. Applejack would have liked\n it to stay that way, Rainbow and herself, just sat around. Applejack \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to open her eyes to acknowledge Dash; they both knew \nthat presence was merely enough.\nYet, Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t make that possible. She had to keep up the whole \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 charade. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just bask in the ambience of Equestria, not when other ponies were around. \n\nDash was so intent on keeping their \xe2\x80\x98rivalry\xe2\x80\x99 up, that it seemed to be \nclouding over what they had between them.  Applejack wished, even though\n she thought it a bit foalish to do so, but she still wished. She wished\n that Dash could just learn to switch off.\nEven though Applejack had such feelings for her, Dash was starting to wear \non her patience. As time went on, more time, according to Dash, had to \nbe spent \xe2\x80\x98keeping up appearances\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nAs much as Applejack hated to have to lie to everypony, as the two of them put more and more effort into covering up, times like these became more and more precious. They came to mean \nmore than they ever used to.\nTimes when Applejack and Dash had nowhere to be, nothing to do. Just to be. \nTo be, but together.\n\nHowever, as much as Applejack wanted to dwell on such a seldom moment like this,\n she knew she had to break her much sought silence, and for a  conversation she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to start. In fact, Applejack was  quite sure, for a moment, at least, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of  honesty, well\xe2\x80\xa6 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even thought of starting a conversation about such a thing.\nEspecially when the obvious results weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be something either pony engaged would have wanted, but Applejack knew what the right thing to do\n was. \nFor a moment, Applejack caught herself thinking.\n\xe2\x80\x98If only I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of Honesty.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nApplejacksighed, but unlike Dash\xe2\x80\x99s earlier sigh, it was an exasperated, annoyed \nsigh. Even though she was troubled with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to  disown her own element, Applejack knew she was in the wrong, and she knew that if she could accept it already, her honesty wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far gone.\n\nNevertheless, this only accentuated Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thought. This conversation needed to happen. If she was questioning her own element, well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be like questioning a cutie mark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, yet harsh, overshadowed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s now increasing breaths. At least Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only anxious pony.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in tarnation was last night about, eh?\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still hushed, yet not as quiet as it had been, she had Dash to contend with as well, now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nDash cut herself short. Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, she\xe2\x80\x99d sounded uncertain from the first letter of her name.\nApplejack opened her eyes, into the sunlight. Everything was bleached, shades of  white. She looked over her shoulder, at Dash, and smiled, even though  the rainbow pony looked so morose. \nIt was strange, seeing the majestic Dash in a whitened colourless format. \nIt was almost as if she was a different pony.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash looked up to the sky.\n\nShe could feel the words she wanted to say, building up inside of her. Yet, none of them would come out, no matter how hard she coaxed them.  Rainbow was annoyed by this. It was almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control  herself at all.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad when it had just been her wings that acted up, but now? Everything was moving too fast.\nNot in speed, of course, Rainbow was still the fastest, she was quite sure of that. It was just in everything else she did.\nIt was as if Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her own hooves anymore. Seemingly, it belonged to everypony else. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash, y\xe2\x80\x99know you can say anything to me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was still looking to the sky for answers.  She remembered the days in which she could just fly, not thinking about anything, just to move, and fast!\nThe sky had stayed the same since then, a place where a pony can be free, no worries, no thoughts. \nIt was funny, but upsetting. The sky, which had been her friend, was unable to help her, as it was free, emotionless.\n\nRainbow Dash levelled her gaze, and brought her eyes to meet Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s. As \nmuch as she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to stare away, and let time go on; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\n just let Applejack hang like that. After all, it was her own fault.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6 so sorry\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt her eyes begin to water, and a wave of melancholy hit her, with more force than she thought it would.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for what I said, and what I did\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven though it was an apology, it was bittersweet. For even though Rainbow \nknew she was saying the right thing, the right feelings weren\xe2\x80\x99t behind \nthem. Mainly, this was due to the fact that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really remember\n what she was apologising for.\n\nThere were things that Rainbow did remember, though. She remembered that the \nwhole night was shrouded by her own crestfallen state. She remembered \nsitting with Applejack, crying into her mane, and most of all, the \noverwhelming feeling of regret.\nOne particular image stuck in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head; the morose smile of a pony, one who looked let down, deceived. \nA pony with beautiful, green eyes. \nHowbeit, Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, not anymore, as they were clouded, hidden  behind a veil of emotion. Even though they tried to be honest, to be dependable, Rainbow knew them well. \nShe knew that they were anything but.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow gasped.\nThat was brash, even for Applejack.\n\nRainbow tried to keep her gaze locked with Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, but the dampness of her\n own eyes forced her to look down at the ground, as she tried to regain \ncontrol of her own tear ducts.\n\nRainbow thought for a while. \n\xe2\x80\x98What about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTwilight was nice, and all. Well, she was very nice.\n\nInitially, Dash had thought that Twilight was boring, always buried in books, telling everypony \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting facts\xe2\x80\x9d, obsessed with learning. Dash was her friend; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the things Twilight did.\n\nYet, over time, Twilight changed.\nNot completely. She still had a thirst for knowledge, as she probably \nalways would. In fact, it was probably that thirst for knowledge that \nchanged her; due to her study of friendship.\nTwilight had developed a whole new social side, and Rainbow liked it.\n\nHowever, Twilight still had much to learn, and Rainbow knew so. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d asked Twilight to come out? \n\nFor Rainbow, it was nice to be the one teaching, for once. Not to be the \none in control, but to be able to help another pony, who\xe2\x80\x99d have complete\n faith in her, even if she only knew a little.\n\nIt was a nice change to how things with herself and Applejack went. They \nwere just stumbling around in the dark; neither pony had known how \nanything had \xe2\x80\x98worked\xe2\x80\x99, per se.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d been uncertain, and each time spur of the moment, and that was fine, for Dash, at the time. After all, she was \xe2\x80\x98The Fastest Flier in all of Equestria,\xe2\x80\x99 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for anything serious. \nNot that she\xe2\x80\x99d known what anything serious would have actually meant.\n\nHowever, Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she wanted that anymore.\nShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure about herself anymore.\n\nEventhough her time with Twilight had been short and impulsive, much like the spurts of time she\xe2\x80\x99d spent with Applejack, Rainbow could see the start of something much more reliable with Twilight. \nReliable.\n\nWas that what she needed?\n\nWas that what she wanted?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice still wavered, huskier than usual, the immersion in emotion taking its toll on her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6I need to go and think, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n    \nRainbow looked back towards Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, once more. Her green eyes were no longer just clouded. The clouds had burst, and begun to leak; two lines traced across the freckles that pockmarked her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always moving, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just slow down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack sounded hurt. It was as if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to hide it now, her honesty shining bright, even when shrouded in upset.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about it properly, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6 but another time. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow hated having to shirk such an important talk off, especially in one of the few times the two of them would normally so desperately strive to have. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just need to sort my head out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh can see that, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow passed an unhappy smile Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s way. She knew she needed to sort it out, but the words Applejack had fed back had hurt. \nBut Rainbow knew she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. \nShe was the element of honesty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked it out\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s words faltered, momentarily, and a thought lapsed up; \xe2\x80\x98Was that really the best thing to say?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt her chest tighten.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stood up, rather more quickly than she meant to, and with the biggest  trace of a reassuring smile as she could muster, she turned away from  Applejack, and began the decent from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, step by step, down between the apple trees, letting their swaying branches\xe2\x80\x99 sounds engulf her once more.\n\nRainbow Dash just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to fly.', 'chapter_number': 6, 'parent_chapter_id': 56, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'6\'></a><h3>With You</h3>\n<p>Chills surrounded Rainbow Dash.</p><p>Chills of temperature, and chills of doubt.</p><p class="double">Rainbow had never really experienced doubt before; she was a confident, strong, \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 pony. </p><p>Only twice had she done so, yet her previous experiences still hadn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>managed to shirk the way it smothered her.

Just to be. </p><p>To be, but together.</p><p class="double">However, as much as Applejack wanted to dwell on such a seldom moment like this,</p><p> she knew she had to break her much sought silence, and for a&nbsp;&nbsp;conversation she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to start. In fact, Applejack was&nbsp;&nbsp;quite sure, for a moment, at least, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of&nbsp;&nbsp;honesty, well\xe2\x80\xa6 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even thought of starting a conversation about such a thing.</p><p>Especially when the obvious results weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be something either pony engaged would have wanted, but Applejack knew what the right thing to do</p><p> was. </p><p>For a moment, Applejack caught herself thinking.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98If only I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of Honesty.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Applejacksighed, but unlike Dash\xe2\x80\x99s earlier sigh, it was an exasperated, annoyed </p><p>sigh. Even though she was troubled with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;disown her own element, Applejack knew she was in the wrong, and she knew that if she could accept it already, her honesty wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far gone.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, this only accentuated Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thought. This conversation needed to happen. If she was questioning her own element, well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be like questioning a cutie mark.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, yet harsh, overshadowed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s now increasing breaths. At least Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only anxious pony.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in tarnation was last night about, eh?</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still hushed, yet not as quiet as it had been, she had Dash to contend with as well, now.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Dash cut herself short. Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, she\xe2\x80\x99d sounded uncertain from the first letter of her name.</p><p>Applejack opened her eyes, into the sunlight. Everything was bleached, shades of&nbsp;&nbsp;white. She looked over her shoulder, at Dash, and smiled, even though&nbsp;&nbsp;the rainbow pony looked so morose. </p><p>It was strange, seeing the majestic Dash in a whitened colourless format. </p><p>It was almost as if she was a different pony.</p><p class="double"></p><p>*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow Dash looked up to the sky.</p><p class="double">She could feel the words she wanted to say, building up inside of her. Yet, none of them would come out, no matter how hard she coaxed them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainbow was annoyed by this. It was almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control&nbsp;&nbsp;herself at all.</p><p>It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad when it had just been her wings that acted up, but now? Everything was moving too fast.</p><p>Not in speed, of course, Rainbow was still the fastest, she was quite sure of that. It was just in everything else she did.</p><p>It was as if Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her own hooves anymore. Seemingly, it belonged to everypony else. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, y\xe2\x80\x99know you can say anything to me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow was still looking to the sky for answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the days in which she could just fly, not thinking about anything, just to move, and fast!</p><p>The sky had stayed the same since then, a place where a pony can be free, no worries, no thoughts. </p><p>It was funny, but upsetting. The sky, which had been her friend, was unable to help her, as it was free, emotionless.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash levelled her gaze, and brought her eyes to meet Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s. As </p><p>much as she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to stare away, and let time go on; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t</p><p> just let Applejack hang like that. After all, it was her own fault.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6 so sorry\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt her eyes begin to water, and a wave of melancholy hit her, with more force than she thought it would.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for what I said, and what I did\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Even though it was an apology, it was bittersweet. For even though Rainbow </p><p>knew she was saying the right thing, the right feelings weren\xe2\x80\x99t behind </p><p>them. Mainly, this was due to the fact that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really remember</p><p> what she was apologising for.</p><p class="double">There were things that Rainbow did remember, though. She remembered that the </p><p>whole night was shrouded by her own crestfallen state. She remembered </p><p>sitting with Applejack, crying into her mane, and most of all, the </p><p>overwhelming feeling of regret.</p><p>One particular image stuck in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head; the morose smile of a pony, one who looked let down, deceived. </p><p>A pony with beautiful, green eyes. </p><p>Howbeit, Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, not anymore, as they were clouded, hidden&nbsp;&nbsp;behind a veil of emotion. Even though they tried to be honest, to be dependable, Rainbow knew them well. </p><p>She knew that they were anything but.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow gasped.</p><p>That was brash, even for Applejack.</p><p class="double">Rainbow tried to keep her gaze locked with Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, but the dampness of her</p><p> own eyes forced her to look down at the ground, as she tried to regain </p><p>control of her own tear ducts.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought for a while. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98What about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Twilight was nice, and all. Well, she was very nice.</p><p class="double">Initially, Dash had thought that Twilight was boring, always buried in books, telling everypony \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting facts\xe2\x80\x9d, obsessed with learning. Dash was her friend; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the things Twilight did.</p><p class="double">Yet, over time, Twilight changed.</p><p>Not completely. She still had a thirst for knowledge, as she probably </p><p>always would. In fact, it was probably that thirst for knowledge that </p><p>changed her; due to her study of friendship.</p><p>Twilight had developed a whole new social side, and Rainbow liked it.</p><p class="double">However, Twilight still had much to learn, and Rainbow knew so. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d asked Twilight to come out? </p><p class="double">For Rainbow, it was nice to be the one teaching, for once. Not to be the </p><p>one in control, but to be able to help another pony, who\xe2\x80\x99d have complete</p><p> faith in her, even if she only knew a little.</p><p class="double">It was a nice change to how things with herself and Applejack went. They </p><p>were just stumbling around in the dark; neither pony had known how </p><p>anything had \xe2\x80\x98worked\xe2\x80\x99, per se.</p><p class="double">It\xe2\x80\x99d been uncertain, and each time spur of the moment, and that was fine, for Dash, at the time. After all, she was \xe2\x80\x98The Fastest Flier in all of Equestria,\xe2\x80\x99 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for anything serious. </p><p>Not that she\xe2\x80\x99d known what anything serious would have actually meant.</p><p class="double">However, Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she wanted that anymore.</p><p>She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure about herself anymore.</p><p class="double">Eventhough her time with Twilight had been short and impulsive, much like the spurts of time she\xe2\x80\x99d spent with Applejack, Rainbow could see the start of something much more reliable with Twilight. </p><p>Reliable.</p><p class="double">Was that what she needed?</p><p class="double">Was that what she wanted?</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cUhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice still wavered, huskier than usual, the immersion in emotion taking its toll on her.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6I need to go and think, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow looked back towards Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, once more. Her green eyes were no longer just clouded. The clouds had burst, and begun to leak; two lines traced across the freckles that pockmarked her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always moving, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just slow down?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack sounded hurt. It was as if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to hide it now, her honesty shining bright, even when shrouded in upset.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about it properly, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6 but another time. \xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Rainbow hated having to shirk such an important talk off, especially in one of the few times the two of them would normally so desperately strive to have. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI just need to sort my head out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh can see that, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow passed an unhappy smile Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s way. She knew she needed to sort it out, but the words Applejack had fed back had hurt. </p><p>But Rainbow knew she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. </p><p>She was the element of honesty.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked it out\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s words faltered, momentarily, and a thought lapsed up; \xe2\x80\x98Was that really the best thing to say?\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt her chest tighten.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI promise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow stood up, rather more quickly than she meant to, and with the biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;trace of a reassuring smile as she could muster, she turned away from&nbsp;&nbsp;Applejack, and began the decent from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, step by step, down between the apple trees, letting their swaying branches\xe2\x80\x99 sounds engulf her once more.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to fly.</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 15}, 'chapter_id': 56, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x02E5FB70>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'6\'></a><h3>With You</h3>\n<p>Chills surrounded Rainbow Dash.</p><p>Chills of temperature, and chills of doubt.</p><p class="double">Rainbow had never really experienced doubt before; she was a confident, strong, \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 pony. </p><p>Only twice had she done so, yet her previous experiences still hadn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>managed to shirk the way it smothered her.

Nor did it lessen the blow on\n her insides; lurching around with every contemplation of every possible\n eventuality.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d thought that the somewhat scenic walk through the apple orchards \ncoating Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill would be able to calm her, to ease her angst, \nyet, as Rainbow increased in her altitude, she got further and further \naway from what felt safe. Rainbow thought this was odd, as she\xe2\x80\x99d \nnormally feel at ease rushing up through the clouds, engulfed in their \nstrangely comforting, soft, ethereal feel. Nevertheless, now, they \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t emanate any positive vibes at all; the cool positivity now seemed\n like cold, sad detachment. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Rainbow thought, anyway.\nPerhaps she was spending too much time with earth ponies.\n\nThe systematic abundance of the apple trees didn\xe2\x80\x99t help Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s state of \nmind either. With each tree she passed, her mind wandered more and more \ntowards Applejack, and what Rainbow had said to her. \nNot that Rainbow really remembered.\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s letter had jogged her memory a tad, and the wound upon Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head \nhad helped it on its way, but it still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all there.\n\nShe remembered about Twilight and herself, almost begrudgingly. However, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t remembering the events that jarred Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s mind so. It was her own thoughts and feelings. \nThoughts and feelings that nopony could really synthesise, even in \nretrospect. They were very much real.\n\nFrom Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s experience, she only knew these feelings from a tiny amount \nof night encounters before, but all from the same place.\n\nA place which now, seemed only to be foreshadowed with doubt, despite its open, airy atmosphere.\n\nBloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nTwilight was sprawled out on her sofa, happy, merely through just existing. She \nexhaled, in a long sigh, finally relaxed after her night on cold enamel \nand water.\n\nOn breathing back in, Twilight noticed a slight odour. One that was \nsomewhat familiar, yet alien, to the library at least. She moved her \ngaze down, and against the white fabric of the sofa, Twilight saw faint,\n pale fibres. Curiously, Twilight brought her head down to the fabric, \nand gave it a quick, speculative sniff. \nTwilight knew that was quite unscientific, and could be considered as odd,\n but in the situation, she\xe2\x80\x99d decided it was the right thing to do. \nBesides, nopony was in the library with her, so nopony else would know \nto be able to call it odd. Not that she would have minded, anyway.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, Twilight realised what was so familiar about the \nscent, after all, she\xe2\x80\x99d spent a good part of the night before engulfed \nin it. The scent had caressed her, surrounded her and been with her.\n\nTwilight lightly pushed her face into the sofa\xe2\x80\x99s cushions, and inhaled as deeply\n as she could, swimming in the memories of Rainbow and herself. Yet, as \nshe was deepest in thought, she involuntarily broke down into a fit of \nchildish giggles. \n\xe2\x80\x98Wow, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99 she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98That really was odd\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRegardless, Twilight just immersed herself in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent once more. She\xe2\x80\x99d \noften wondered why everypony in romance novels did things like this; \njust sitting, thinking about their loved ones, inhaling their scent. \n\nNow, though, things were different.\n\nPerhaps, like in those books, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t odd, but she was in love.\n\nTwilight inhaled another gasp of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent, and filled her thoughts with \nthe pegasus. Nopony had ever quite shone in this sort of light to \nTwilight before, and so, she intended to make the most of it.\nAfter all, it felt good.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nApplejack had been laid out on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill for quite some time now, \nexasperated. Not that she minded the location, but she really had to get\n back to work on the farm.  She was the most dependable pony in Ponyville, and knew she really should get back to bucking, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing anything.\n\nNot out of laziness, Applejack was far from lazy, and she knew it; but somehow, that made it worse.\nHowever, her disdain for it did nothing to counteract it. The one thing that \ngave Applejack solace was that at least she knew what was causing her \nlistlessness.\n\nLight hoof-fall began to puncture the murmuring soundscape of rustling leaves\n and light breeze, and with each muffled clop, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts \nbegan to run amok. She was painting situations in her head, some more \nbrash, whilst others were tenderer.\n\nApplejack knew it was silly, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop acting the scenes out in the safety of her own mind.\nShe could get the words just right in there.\n\nThere was a modest sound of setting down, beside her, and Applejack, still with her eyes firmly closed, knew who was there.\n\nShe heard a sigh. Not one of exasperation, but a long, drawn out sigh of relief. Applejack found it reassuring.\n\nShe laid there, basking in the sunlight, alongside her counterpart, just \ndoing nothing, just revelling in her company. Applejack would have liked\n it to stay that way, Rainbow and herself, just sat around. Applejack \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to open her eyes to acknowledge Dash; they both knew \nthat presence was merely enough.\nYet, Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t make that possible. She had to keep up the whole \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 charade. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just bask in the ambience of Equestria, not when other ponies were around. \n\nDash was so intent on keeping their \xe2\x80\x98rivalry\xe2\x80\x99 up, that it seemed to be \nclouding over what they had between them.  Applejack wished, even though\n she thought it a bit foalish to do so, but she still wished. She wished\n that Dash could just learn to switch off.\nEven though Applejack had such feelings for her, Dash was starting to wear \non her patience. As time went on, more time, according to Dash, had to \nbe spent \xe2\x80\x98keeping up appearances\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nAs much as Applejack hated to have to lie to everypony, as the two of them put more and more effort into covering up, times like these became more and more precious. They came to mean \nmore than they ever used to.\nTimes when Applejack and Dash had nowhere to be, nothing to do. Just to be. \nTo be, but together.\n\nHowever, as much as Applejack wanted to dwell on such a seldom moment like this,\n she knew she had to break her much sought silence, and for a  conversation she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to start. In fact, Applejack was  quite sure, for a moment, at least, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of  honesty, well\xe2\x80\xa6 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even thought of starting a conversation about such a thing.\nEspecially when the obvious results weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be something either pony engaged would have wanted, but Applejack knew what the right thing to do\n was. \nFor a moment, Applejack caught herself thinking.\n\xe2\x80\x98If only I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of Honesty.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nApplejacksighed, but unlike Dash\xe2\x80\x99s earlier sigh, it was an exasperated, annoyed \nsigh. Even though she was troubled with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to  disown her own element, Applejack knew she was in the wrong, and she knew that if she could accept it already, her honesty wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far gone.\n\nNevertheless, this only accentuated Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thought. This conversation needed to happen. If she was questioning her own element, well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be like questioning a cutie mark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, yet harsh, overshadowed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s now increasing breaths. At least Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only anxious pony.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in tarnation was last night about, eh?\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still hushed, yet not as quiet as it had been, she had Dash to contend with as well, now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nDash cut herself short. Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, she\xe2\x80\x99d sounded uncertain from the first letter of her name.\nApplejack opened her eyes, into the sunlight. Everything was bleached, shades of  white. She looked over her shoulder, at Dash, and smiled, even though  the rainbow pony looked so morose. \nIt was strange, seeing the majestic Dash in a whitened colourless format. \nIt was almost as if she was a different pony.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash looked up to the sky.\n\nShe could feel the words she wanted to say, building up inside of her. Yet, none of them would come out, no matter how hard she coaxed them.  Rainbow was annoyed by this. It was almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control  herself at all.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad when it had just been her wings that acted up, but now? Everything was moving too fast.\nNot in speed, of course, Rainbow was still the fastest, she was quite sure of that. It was just in everything else she did.\nIt was as if Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her own hooves anymore. Seemingly, it belonged to everypony else. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash, y\xe2\x80\x99know you can say anything to me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was still looking to the sky for answers.  She remembered the days in which she could just fly, not thinking about anything, just to move, and fast!\nThe sky had stayed the same since then, a place where a pony can be free, no worries, no thoughts. \nIt was funny, but upsetting. The sky, which had been her friend, was unable to help her, as it was free, emotionless.\n\nRainbow Dash levelled her gaze, and brought her eyes to meet Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s. As \nmuch as she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to stare away, and let time go on; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\n just let Applejack hang like that.

For even though Rainbow \nknew she was saying the right thing, the right feelings weren\xe2\x80\x99t behind \nthem. Mainly, this was due to the fact that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really remember\n what she was apologising for.\n\nThere were things that Rainbow did remember, though. She remembered that the \nwhole night was shrouded by her own crestfallen state. She remembered \nsitting with Applejack, crying into her mane, and most of all, the \noverwhelming feeling of regret.\nOne particular image stuck in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head; the morose smile of a pony, one who looked let down, deceived. \nA pony with beautiful, green eyes. \nHowbeit, Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, not anymore, as they were clouded, hidden  behind a veil of emotion. Even though they tried to be honest, to be dependable, Rainbow knew them well. \nShe knew that they were anything but.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow gasped.\nThat was brash, even for Applejack.\n\nRainbow tried to keep her gaze locked with Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, but the dampness of her\n own eyes forced her to look down at the ground, as she tried to regain \ncontrol of her own tear ducts.\n\nRainbow thought for a while. \n\xe2\x80\x98What about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTwilight was nice, and all.

She </p><p>exhaled, in a long sigh, finally relaxed after her night on cold enamel </p><p>and water.</p><p class="double">On breathing back in, Twilight noticed a slight odour. One that was </p><p>somewhat familiar, yet alien, to the library at least. She moved her </p><p>gaze down, and against the white fabric of the sofa, Twilight saw faint,</p><p> pale fibres. Curiously, Twilight brought her head down to the fabric, </p><p>and gave it a quick, speculative sniff. </p><p>Twilight knew that was quite unscientific, and could be considered as odd,</p><p> but in the situation, she\xe2\x80\x99d decided it was the right thing to do. </p><p>Besides, nopony was in the library with her, so nopony else would know </p><p>to be able to call it odd. Not that she would have minded, anyway.</p><p class="double">After a couple of minutes, Twilight realised what was so familiar about the </p><p>scent, after all, she\xe2\x80\x99d spent a good part of the night before engulfed </p><p>in it. The scent had caressed her, surrounded her and been with her.</p><p class="double">Twilight lightly pushed her face into the sofa\xe2\x80\x99s cushions, and inhaled as deeply</p><p> as she could, swimming in the memories of Rainbow and herself. Yet, as </p><p>she was deepest in thought, she involuntarily broke down into a fit of </p><p>childish giggles. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98Wow, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99 she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98That really was odd\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Regardless, Twilight just immersed herself in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent once more. She\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>often wondered why everypony in romance novels did things like this; </p><p>just sitting, thinking about their loved ones, inhaling their scent. </p><p class="double">Now, though, things were different.</p><p class="double">Perhaps, like in those books, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t odd, but she was in love.</p><p class="double">Twilight inhaled another gasp of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent, and filled her thoughts with </p><p>the pegasus. Nopony had ever quite shone in this sort of light to </p><p>Twilight before, and so, she intended to make the most of it.</p><p>After all, it felt good.</p><p class="double"></p><p>*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Applejack had been laid out on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill for quite some time now, </p><p>exasperated. Not that she minded the location, but she really had to get</p><p> back to work on the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the most dependable pony in Ponyville, and knew she really should get back to bucking, but\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p>Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing anything.</p><p class="double">Not out of laziness, Applejack was far from lazy, and she knew it; but somehow, that made it worse.</p><p>However, her disdain for it did nothing to counteract it. The one thing that </p><p>gave Applejack solace was that at least she knew what was causing her </p><p>listlessness.</p><p class="double">Light hoof-fall began to puncture the murmuring soundscape of rustling leaves</p><p> and light breeze, and with each muffled clop, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts </p><p>began to run amok. She was painting situations in her head, some more </p><p>brash, whilst others were tenderer.</p><p class="double">Applejack knew it was silly, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop acting the scenes out in the safety of her own mind.</p><p>She could get the words just right in there.</p><p class="double">There was a modest sound of setting down, beside her, and Applejack, still with her eyes firmly closed, knew who was there.</p><p class="double">She heard a sigh. Not one of exasperation, but a long, drawn out sigh of relief. Applejack found it reassuring.</p><p class="double">She laid there, basking in the sunlight, alongside her counterpart, just </p><p>doing nothing, just revelling in her company. Applejack would have liked</p><p> it to stay that way, Rainbow and herself, just sat around. Applejack </p><p>didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to open her eyes to acknowledge Dash; they both knew </p><p>that presence was merely enough.</p><p>Yet, Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t make that possible. She had to keep up the whole \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 charade. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just bask in the ambience of Equestria, not when other ponies were around. </p><p class="double">Dash was so intent on keeping their \xe2\x80\x98rivalry\xe2\x80\x99 up, that it seemed to be </p><p>clouding over what they had between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applejack wished, even though</p><p> she thought it a bit foalish to do so, but she still wished. She wished</p><p> that Dash could just learn to switch off.</p><p>Even though Applejack had such feelings for her, Dash was starting to wear </p><p>on her patience. As time went on, more time, according to Dash, had to </p><p>be spent \xe2\x80\x98keeping up appearances\xe2\x80\x99.</p><p class="double">As much as Applejack hated to have to lie to everypony, as the two of them put more and more effort into covering up, times like these became more and more precious. They came to mean </p><p>more than they ever used to.</p><p>Times when Applejack and Dash had nowhere to be, nothing to do. Just to be. </p><p>To be, but together.</p><p class="double">However, as much as Applejack wanted to dwell on such a seldom moment like this,</p><p> she knew she had to break her much sought silence, and for a&nbsp;&nbsp;conversation she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to start. In fact, Applejack was&nbsp;&nbsp;quite sure, for a moment, at least, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of&nbsp;&nbsp;honesty, well\xe2\x80\xa6 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even thought of starting a conversation about such a thing.</p><p>Especially when the obvious results weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be something either pony engaged would have wanted, but Applejack knew what the right thing to do</p><p> was. </p><p>For a moment, Applejack caught herself thinking.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98If only I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of Honesty.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Applejacksighed, but unlike Dash\xe2\x80\x99s earlier sigh, it was an exasperated, annoyed </p><p>sigh. Even though she was troubled with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;disown her own element, Applejack knew she was in the wrong, and she knew that if she could accept it already, her honesty wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far gone.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, this only accentuated Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thought. This conversation needed to happen. If she was questioning her own element, well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be like questioning a cutie mark.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, yet harsh, overshadowed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s now increasing breaths. At least Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only anxious pony.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in tarnation was last night about, eh?</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still hushed, yet not as quiet as it had been, she had Dash to contend with as well, now.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="double">Dash cut herself short. Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, she\xe2\x80\x99d sounded uncertain from the first letter of her name.</p><p>Applejack opened her eyes, into the sunlight. Everything was bleached, shades of&nbsp;&nbsp;white. She looked over her shoulder, at Dash, and smiled, even though&nbsp;&nbsp;the rainbow pony looked so morose. </p><p>It was strange, seeing the majestic Dash in a whitened colourless format. </p><p>It was almost as if she was a different pony.</p><p class="double"></p><p>*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow Dash looked up to the sky.</p><p class="double">She could feel the words she wanted to say, building up inside of her. Yet, none of them would come out, no matter how hard she coaxed them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainbow was annoyed by this. It was almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control&nbsp;&nbsp;herself at all.</p><p>It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad when it had just been her wings that acted up, but now? Everything was moving too fast.</p><p>Not in speed, of course, Rainbow was still the fastest, she was quite sure of that. It was just in everything else she did.</p><p>It was as if Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her own hooves anymore. Seemingly, it belonged to everypony else. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, y\xe2\x80\x99know you can say anything to me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow was still looking to the sky for answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the days in which she could just fly, not thinking about anything, just to move, and fast!</p><p>The sky had stayed the same since then, a place where a pony can be free, no worries, no thoughts. </p><p>It was funny, but upsetting. The sky, which had been her friend, was unable to help her, as it was free, emotionless.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash levelled her gaze, and brought her eyes to meet Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s. As </p><p>much as she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to stare away, and let time go on; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t</p><p> just let Applejack hang like that. After all, it was her own fault.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6 so sorry\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow felt her eyes begin to water, and a wave of melancholy hit her, with more force than she thought it would.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for what I said, and what I did\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Even though it was an apology, it was bittersweet. For even though Rainbow </p><p>knew she was saying the right thing, the right feelings weren\xe2\x80\x99t behind </p><p>them. Mainly, this was due to the fact that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really remember</p><p> what she was apologising for.</p><p class="double">There were things that Rainbow did remember, though. She remembered that the </p><p>whole night was shrouded by her own crestfallen state. She remembered </p><p>sitting with Applejack, crying into her mane, and most of all, the </p><p>overwhelming feeling of regret.</p><p>One particular image stuck in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head; the morose smile of a pony, one who looked let down, deceived. </p><p>A pony with beautiful, green eyes. </p><p>Howbeit, Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, not anymore, as they were clouded, hidden&nbsp;&nbsp;behind a veil of emotion. Even though they tried to be honest, to be dependable, Rainbow knew them well. </p><p>She knew that they were anything but.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Rainbow gasped.</p><p>That was brash, even for Applejack.</p><p class="double">Rainbow tried to keep her gaze locked with Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, but the dampness of her</p><p> own eyes forced her to look down at the ground, as she tried to regain </p><p>control of her own tear ducts.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought for a while. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98What about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="double">Twilight was nice, and all. Well, she was very nice.</p><p class="double">Initially, Dash had thought that Twilight was boring, always buried in books, telling everypony \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting facts\xe2\x80\x9d, obsessed with learning. Dash was her friend; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the things Twilight did.</p><p class="double">Yet, over time, Twilight changed.</p><p>Not completely. She still had a thirst for knowledge, as she probably </p><p>always would. In fact, it was probably that thirst for knowledge that </p><p>changed her; due to her study of friendship.</p><p>Twilight had developed a whole new social side, and Rainbow liked it.</p><p class="double">However, Twilight still had much to learn, and Rainbow knew so. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d asked Twilight to come out? </p><p class="double">For Rainbow, it was nice to be the one teaching, for once. Not to be the </p><p>one in control, but to be able to help another pony, who\xe2\x80\x99d have complete</p><p> faith in her, even if she only knew a little.</p><p class="double">It was a nice change to how things with herself and Applejack went.

One that was \nsomewhat familiar, yet alien, to the library at least. She moved her \ngaze down, and against the white fabric of the sofa, Twilight saw faint,\n pale fibres. Curiously, Twilight brought her head down to the fabric, \nand gave it a quick, speculative sniff. \nTwilight knew that was quite unscientific, and could be considered as odd,\n but in the situation, she\xe2\x80\x99d decided it was the right thing to do. \nBesides, nopony was in the library with her, so nopony else would know \nto be able to call it odd. Not that she would have minded, anyway.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, Twilight realised what was so familiar about the \nscent, after all, she\xe2\x80\x99d spent a good part of the night before engulfed \nin it. The scent had caressed her, surrounded her and been with her.\n\nTwilight lightly pushed her face into the sofa\xe2\x80\x99s cushions, and inhaled as deeply\n as she could, swimming in the memories of Rainbow and herself. Yet, as \nshe was deepest in thought, she involuntarily broke down into a fit of \nchildish giggles. \n\xe2\x80\x98Wow, Twilight\xe2\x80\x99 she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x98That really was odd\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRegardless, Twilight just immersed herself in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent once more. She\xe2\x80\x99d \noften wondered why everypony in romance novels did things like this; \njust sitting, thinking about their loved ones, inhaling their scent. \n\nNow, though, things were different.\n\nPerhaps, like in those books, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t odd, but she was in love.\n\nTwilight inhaled another gasp of Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s scent, and filled her thoughts with \nthe pegasus. Nopony had ever quite shone in this sort of light to \nTwilight before, and so, she intended to make the most of it.\nAfter all, it felt good.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nApplejack had been laid out on Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill for quite some time now, \nexasperated. Not that she minded the location, but she really had to get\n back to work on the farm.  She was the most dependable pony in Ponyville, and knew she really should get back to bucking, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing anything.\n\nNot out of laziness, Applejack was far from lazy, and she knew it; but somehow, that made it worse.\nHowever, her disdain for it did nothing to counteract it. The one thing that \ngave Applejack solace was that at least she knew what was causing her \nlistlessness.\n\nLight hoof-fall began to puncture the murmuring soundscape of rustling leaves\n and light breeze, and with each muffled clop, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts \nbegan to run amok. She was painting situations in her head, some more \nbrash, whilst others were tenderer.\n\nApplejack knew it was silly, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop acting the scenes out in the safety of her own mind.\nShe could get the words just right in there.\n\nThere was a modest sound of setting down, beside her, and Applejack, still with her eyes firmly closed, knew who was there.\n\nShe heard a sigh. Not one of exasperation, but a long, drawn out sigh of relief. Applejack found it reassuring.\n\nShe laid there, basking in the sunlight, alongside her counterpart, just \ndoing nothing, just revelling in her company. Applejack would have liked\n it to stay that way, Rainbow and herself, just sat around. Applejack \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to open her eyes to acknowledge Dash; they both knew \nthat presence was merely enough.\nYet, Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t make that possible. She had to keep up the whole \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 charade. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just bask in the ambience of Equestria, not when other ponies were around. \n\nDash was so intent on keeping their \xe2\x80\x98rivalry\xe2\x80\x99 up, that it seemed to be \nclouding over what they had between them.  Applejack wished, even though\n she thought it a bit foalish to do so, but she still wished. She wished\n that Dash could just learn to switch off.\nEven though Applejack had such feelings for her, Dash was starting to wear \non her patience. As time went on, more time, according to Dash, had to \nbe spent \xe2\x80\x98keeping up appearances\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nAs much as Applejack hated to have to lie to everypony, as the two of them put more and more effort into covering up, times like these became more and more precious. They came to mean \nmore than they ever used to.\nTimes when Applejack and Dash had nowhere to be, nothing to do. Just to be. \nTo be, but together.\n\nHowever, as much as Applejack wanted to dwell on such a seldom moment like this,\n she knew she had to break her much sought silence, and for a  conversation she didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to start. In fact, Applejack was  quite sure, for a moment, at least, if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of  honesty, well\xe2\x80\xa6 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even thought of starting a conversation about such a thing.\nEspecially when the obvious results weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be something either pony engaged would have wanted, but Applejack knew what the right thing to do\n was. \nFor a moment, Applejack caught herself thinking.\n\xe2\x80\x98If only I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the element of Honesty.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nApplejacksighed, but unlike Dash\xe2\x80\x99s earlier sigh, it was an exasperated, annoyed \nsigh. Even though she was troubled with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to  disown her own element, Applejack knew she was in the wrong, and she knew that if she could accept it already, her honesty wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far gone.\n\nNevertheless, this only accentuated Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s thought. This conversation needed to happen. If she was questioning her own element, well, that\xe2\x80\x99d be like questioning a cutie mark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was quiet, yet harsh, overshadowed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s now increasing breaths. At least Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only anxious pony.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in tarnation was last night about, eh?\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still hushed, yet not as quiet as it had been, she had Dash to contend with as well, now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nDash cut herself short. Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, she\xe2\x80\x99d sounded uncertain from the first letter of her name.\nApplejack opened her eyes, into the sunlight. Everything was bleached, shades of  white. She looked over her shoulder, at Dash, and smiled, even though  the rainbow pony looked so morose. \nIt was strange, seeing the majestic Dash in a whitened colourless format. \nIt was almost as if she was a different pony.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nRainbow Dash looked up to the sky.\n\nShe could feel the words she wanted to say, building up inside of her. Yet, none of them would come out, no matter how hard she coaxed them.  Rainbow was annoyed by this. It was almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t control  herself at all.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad when it had just been her wings that acted up, but now? Everything was moving too fast.\nNot in speed, of course, Rainbow was still the fastest, she was quite sure of that. It was just in everything else she did.\nIt was as if Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her own hooves anymore. Seemingly, it belonged to everypony else. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash, y\xe2\x80\x99know you can say anything to me, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow was still looking to the sky for answers.  She remembered the days in which she could just fly, not thinking about anything, just to move, and fast!\nThe sky had stayed the same since then, a place where a pony can be free, no worries, no thoughts. \nIt was funny, but upsetting. The sky, which had been her friend, was unable to help her, as it was free, emotionless.\n\nRainbow Dash levelled her gaze, and brought her eyes to meet Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s. As \nmuch as she\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to stare away, and let time go on; Rainbow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\n just let Applejack hang like that. After all, it was her own fault.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6 so sorry\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt her eyes begin to water, and a wave of melancholy hit her, with more force than she thought it would.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for what I said, and what I did\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven though it was an apology, it was bittersweet. For even though Rainbow \nknew she was saying the right thing, the right feelings weren\xe2\x80\x99t behind \nthem. Mainly, this was due to the fact that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really remember\n what she was apologising for.\n\nThere were things that Rainbow did remember, though. She remembered that the \nwhole night was shrouded by her own crestfallen state. She remembered \nsitting with Applejack, crying into her mane, and most of all, the \noverwhelming feeling of regret.\nOne particular image stuck in Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s head; the morose smile of a pony, one who looked let down, deceived. \nA pony with beautiful, green eyes. \nHowbeit, Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, not anymore, as they were clouded, hidden  behind a veil of emotion. Even though they tried to be honest, to be dependable, Rainbow knew them well. \nShe knew that they were anything but.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow gasped.\nThat was brash, even for Applejack.\n\nRainbow tried to keep her gaze locked with Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s, but the dampness of her\n own eyes forced her to look down at the ground, as she tried to regain \ncontrol of her own tear ducts.\n\nRainbow thought for a while. \n\xe2\x80\x98What about Twilight?\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTwilight was nice, and all. Well, she was very nice.\n\nInitially, Dash had thought that Twilight was boring, always buried in books, telling everypony \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting facts\xe2\x80\x9d, obsessed with learning. Dash was her friend; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the things Twilight did.\n\nYet, over time, Twilight changed.\nNot completely. She still had a thirst for knowledge, as she probably \nalways would. In fact, it was probably that thirst for knowledge that \nchanged her; due to her study of friendship.\nTwilight had developed a whole new social side, and Rainbow liked it.\n\nHowever, Twilight still had much to learn, and Rainbow knew so. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the reason she\xe2\x80\x99d asked Twilight to come out? \n\nFor Rainbow, it was nice to be the one teaching, for once. Not to be the \none in control, but to be able to help another pony, who\xe2\x80\x99d have complete\n faith in her, even if she only knew a little.\n\nIt was a nice change to how things with herself and Applejack went. They \nwere just stumbling around in the dark; neither pony had known how \nanything had \xe2\x80\x98worked\xe2\x80\x99, per se.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99d been uncertain, and each time spur of the moment, and that was fine, for Dash, at the time. After all, she was \xe2\x80\x98The Fastest Flier in all of Equestria,\xe2\x80\x99 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for anything serious. \nNot that she\xe2\x80\x99d known what anything serious would have actually meant.\n\nHowever, Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she wanted that anymore.\nShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure about herself anymore.\n\nEventhough her time with Twilight had been short and impulsive, much like the spurts of time she\xe2\x80\x99d spent with Applejack, Rainbow could see the start of something much more reliable with Twilight. \nReliable.\n\nWas that what she needed?\n\nWas that what she wanted?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUhh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s voice still wavered, huskier than usual, the immersion in emotion taking its toll on her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6I need to go and think, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n    \nRainbow looked back towards Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, once more. Her green eyes were no longer just clouded. The clouds had burst, and begun to leak; two lines traced across the freckles that pockmarked her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always moving, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just slow down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack sounded hurt. It was as if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to hide it now, her honesty shining bright, even when shrouded in upset.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you about it properly, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6 but another time. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nRainbow hated having to shirk such an important talk off, especially in one of the few times the two of them would normally so desperately strive to have. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just need to sort my head out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh can see that, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow passed an unhappy smile Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s way. She knew she needed to sort it out, but the words Applejack had fed back had hurt. \nBut Rainbow knew she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. \nShe was the element of honesty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked it out\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow\xe2\x80\x99s words faltered, momentarily, and a thought lapsed up; \xe2\x80\x98Was that really the best thing to say?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow felt her chest tighten.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRainbow stood up, rather more quickly than she meant to, and with the biggest  trace of a reassuring smile as she could muster, she turned away from  Applejack, and began the decent from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, step by step, down between the apple trees, letting their swaying branches\xe2\x80\x99 sounds engulf her once more.\n\nRainbow Dash just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to fly.', 'epub': None}

It kept her thinking \nabout what could happen, even if the thing that could happen was just \nsomething as trivial as a few moments of silence.\nOr perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the silence at all, but what the silence put into perspective.\n\nThe times lacking in vivacity contrasted Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s presence well, and even if Mrs Cake didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise it sometimes, that was what kept her going. \n\nAlthough nopony really knew it, save for her husband, Mrs Cake probably would \nhave left Sugarcube Corner, if Pinkie Pie hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned up.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the baking of cakes that was the issue; after all, nopony grew \nweary of their cutie mark\xe2\x80\x99s origins. It was the running of the shop \nthat\xe2\x80\x99d made her want to leave. \nEveryday, Mrs Cake would see the same old faces, come to order the same thing, day in, day out. Yet, even though they were such devoted customers, Mrs Cake hardly knew any of them.\nIf any at all.\n\nIt was only ever; \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mrs Cake!\xe2\x80\x9d\nOr an; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like a batch of muffins, please, Mrs Cake!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd then possibly a; \xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, Mrs Cake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs Cake never really knew anypony, after moving to Ponyville, short of her husband, Carrot Cake.\n\nThen, when a young Pinkie Pie had appeared in Ponyville, just, as it turned out, on a whim, Mrs Cake felt reason for staying.\n \nPinkie had exploded into Sugarcube Corner, on a particularly rainy afternoon, \nwhich seemed to have shirked a large number of the Cakes\xe2\x80\x99 customers, and\n turned the whole store hooves-up. \n\nEven though, without Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s permission, the excitable filly Pinkie Pie \nhad eaten much of the shop\xe2\x80\x99s contents, without even so much as \nacknowledging her, Mrs Cake was smiling. \nThis was because, in a short couple of minutes, the young pink filly that Mrs Cake hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even heard mention of before had suddenly managed to show more gratitude for the cakes that she\xe2\x80\x99d baked than everypony before her, put together. \nIt was as the young filly was attempting to climb a particularly tall \nwedding cake, to reach the sickly-sweet candy bride and groom, Mrs Cake \nwas no longer smiling. \n\nFor the First time in a long while, Cup Cake laughed.\n\nIt crept up on her, at first, but as she watched the young pink pony\xe2\x80\x99s \nfurther attempts to climb up the icing-coated tiers, eventually \nresulting in the collapse of the frosting-fortress beneath her, the \nlaugh became louder, until it filled Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s store to the brim.\n\nCandy-ponies in mouth, and with a self-satisfied grin, the young Pinkie Pie spun \naround, noticing Mrs Cake for the first time, and, instead of \napologising, like any other pony might well have done, Pinkie Pie \ndropped the candy newly-weds, and joined in Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s laughter.\n\nAfter the main body of the two\xe2\x80\x99s laughter had subsided, into just a light \ngiggling, the young filly said her first words to Mrs Cake.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re kinda funny, miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs Cake couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but smile, the filly that had appeared in her shop \nand eaten all of her stock, climbing up cakes and spreading icing around\n the room whilst not even realising she was in the presence of another \npony was calling her funny.\n\nThen, before Mrs Cake knew it, Pinkie Pie had taken up residence within \nSugarcube Corner, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Pinkie was Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s life, or so\n it seemed.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better go and open up Sugarcube Corner,\xe2\x80\x9d in the mornings, anymore. \nIt was always \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better go and check in on Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSometimes, to Mrs Cake, it was like Pinkie Pie was the daughter she never had. \nEven if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Pinkie sure brought that laughter into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s \nlife.\n\nWallowing in the thoughts of Pinkie Pie only made the silence worse for Mrs Cake.\n\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so harsh on her, if Carrot Cake had been there, as \nhis presence would have at least incurred on the deathly silence of the \nshop.\n\nHowever, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s absence that had stolen away the sounds from Sugarcube Corner and Mrs Cake. \nIt was the presence of a letter, left behind by the young pink filly that had once burst into her life.\n\nAs abruptly as Pinkie Pie had exploded into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s life, with her \never-present element of laughter, the explosion had died down, leaving \nonly ashes of memories behind.\n\nMrs Cake looked down at the letter Pinkie Pie had left, and as she stared \ninto it, drops began to fall from her eyes, soaking into the paper.\n\nAt least she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with the silence anymore.\n\n\n\n', 'chapter_number': 7, 'parent_chapter_id': 61, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'7\'></a><h3>Interlude</h3>\n<p>An eerie silence shrouded Sugarcube corner.</p><p class="double">It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that Mrs Cake disliked silences; she positively revelled in the </p><p>thought of just snatching couple of quiet seconds, in-between the </p><p>constant flow of customers, and Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s incessant yet overly </p><p>optimistic babble.</p><p>However, when those seconds were snatched by Mrs Cake, they were always somewhat bittersweet. </p><p class="double">In contrast with Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s overbearing, the silence was bland, boring.</p><p> Always, though, Mrs Cake would build the silences up, within her own </p><p>head, growing ever more excited, and when they came along, she would </p><p>always wonder to herself about why she built these moments up to </p><p>herself; as she always knew, in the end, they\xe2\x80\x99d be disappointing. </p><p>Fleeting, too. </p><p>Ending as abruptly as they started, punctuated by the shrill alarm of the </p><p>oven, by the tinkling of the door bell or merely just the living, </p><p>breathing laughter of Pinkie Pie, finding hilarity, even in the mundane </p><p>face of life.</p><p class="double">Mrs Cake supposed it was hope that kept her going.

It kept her thinking \nabout what could happen, even if the thing that could happen was just \nsomething as trivial as a few moments of silence.\nOr perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the silence at all, but what the silence put into perspective.\n\nThe times lacking in vivacity contrasted Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s presence well, and even if Mrs Cake didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise it sometimes, that was what kept her going. \n\nAlthough nopony really knew it, save for her husband, Mrs Cake probably would \nhave left Sugarcube Corner, if Pinkie Pie hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned up.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the baking of cakes that was the issue; after all, nopony grew \nweary of their cutie mark\xe2\x80\x99s origins.

This was because, due to her eagerness to leave, and\n her exceptional organisational skills, she was once again, ready far \ntoo early.\nShe looked up, back towards the literary forest behind her, and called out to her assistant; Spike.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight heard the soft padding of Spike\xe2\x80\x99s steps, ricocheting delicately off of \nthe bounds of information, upon the shelves of the library. Twilight \nliked how the library\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous nature accentuated such sounds. It was\n as if the books were helping her further than anypony thought they \nactually could, relaying real world sounds to her. \nNevertheless, even though the sounds of his steps were all too obvious to Twilight, \nSpike refrained from vocalising his movement.\nHowever, Twilight was kind of expecting this. She suspected that Spike was still\n rather annoyed from having to clean up behind her, and thus, would \nprobably try to make a point, and not speak to her for as long as he \ncould.\nBut, Twilight knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out too long\xe2\x80\xa6 After all, he had to speak to her, Spike was her assistant!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could see that Spike was trying to sound as dejected as he could, but \nlooking at the floor whilst doing so. She was sure that if she could \nmake eye contact with her assistant, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably snap out of his act.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shot up, brightly, away from the forced melancholic stare at the \nground, apparently forgetting all disdain for having to clean up behind \nTwilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, Twi\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight grinned, and instead of replying, she just waited for Spike\xe2\x80\x99s next inevitable question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Rarity be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven though she knew she\xe2\x80\x99d have this question asked of her, Twilight was \nhoping Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, as then, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be the bringer of \nbad news, and twice in one day, at that! First the horrors of cleaning, \nand now this!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t I already tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike looked blankly at Twilight, Obviously she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done so. Or perhaps he forgot?\nNo, Twilight thought to herself; Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything about Rarity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, Rarity won\xe2\x80\x99t be there\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike exhaled loudly, disappointedly, and brought his gaze back down to the floor.\nHowever, Twilight, used to his behaviour, carried on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s away with Fluttershy, on a spa weekend break, I recall her mentioning it last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight took a couple of hoofsteps towards Spike, and gave him a quick tap on \nthe shoulder, and attempted to act more like the mother figure, instead \nof her normal role.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike looked back up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, with a sad smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Twilight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some cleaning to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight let out a quiet chuckle to herself. Even if Spike didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, he always put a grin on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but Spike, Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99ll be there too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight immersed herself in thoughts of Rainbow, reminiscing just from the \ncombination of her name rolling off of her own tongue, mingling with her\n left over scent, still lingering from the night before.\nTwilight just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see Rainbow, even if Pinkie Pie and Applejack were to be at the party too, Twilight was sure she could have Rainbow to herself, for the most part, anyway. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why do you keep mentioning Rainbow Dash? Other ponies will be there too, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight felt a tad embarrassed, again, but managed to hold out on any blush, \nthis time. How had she managed to let Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s name slip out twice!? \nNot that Twilight thought that she ought to hide what she thought the two \nfillies had together. No, she wanted to run around Ponyville, declaring \nher love for Rainbow. Twilight wanted everypony to know.\n\nHowever, Twilight knew two things, both drawn from her time reading romance \nnovels. The first was that, in these novels, it was apparent that most \nof the couples would wait to announce their relationship together, and \nTwilight wanted to be gracious, and give Rainbow that opportunity.\nThe second was that, had Twilight done so, the whole thing would\xe2\x80\x99ve been horribly clich\xc3\xa9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Spike, look at the time! I\xe2\x80\x99d best be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight knew she still had a few more minutes until she was actually scheduled  to leave, but she\xe2\x80\x99d decided that it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be the best to leave early, after all, it meant she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to figure out how to vocalise all these thoughts in her head, and then find a way to convey it so Spike would understand it.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nDue to instinct, Rainbow Dash had headed straight home. \nYet,\n as she lay, sprawled upon her cloud sofa, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel \nthat her relaxation was merely synthesised. Although, at heart, Rainbow \nwanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew\n that she was far from able to do such a thing. \nThe fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.\n\nOf course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny\n little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.\n Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the \ntwo conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nbrain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.\nStill, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the \nwound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, \nRainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.\n\nThinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \ngoing to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that \nwas somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.\nNo, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.\n\nAsmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make \namends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. \nBut even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?\nWithout her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.\n\nYes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. \nRainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be\n itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. \n\nTwilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the \nreason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without \nknowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no \nreason for her to hide it.\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, \nnevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d \nprobably know everything.\nWell, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.\n\nAnyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nApplejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, \nyet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d \npulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or \nrather, her eyes.\n\n Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was \nto it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, \nto cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving \nbelow her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to \nSugarcube Corner.\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably\n wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew \nthat she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.\n\nWhen Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her \nbrother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, \npondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always \ntrying to look cool, all the time.\nYet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. \n\nNot that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. \n\nApplejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash \nwas nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own \nneck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just \nlistened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she \nloved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. \nHowever, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not \nyet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \ndependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.\n\nEven though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular \nenough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.\n\nAlthough the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that\n she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone \nwrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that \nshe wanted to try.\nThe last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not\n have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have \nbeen just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.\n\nApplejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her \ndestination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite \ndirection. A purple filly.\n\nAs Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards \nher, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed \non to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nthoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I really am, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Twilight\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain her joy; it was only moments from her arrival at the party, she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to see Rainbow again!\n\nEscaping from her runaway scenarios in her head, Twilight began to focus back \nonto the real world, after all, she was nearly at Sugarcube Corner, and \nneeded to pay attention to walking, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trot into \nanything.\n\nAs Twilight looked towards the entrance of the store, she could not only \nsee the ornate cakey exterior of Sugarcube Corner, but the contrasting \norange of Applejack, waiting by the door, looking to the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight called out loudly, yet she got no response. Applejack just kept gazing \ninto the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps \nApplejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.\n\nReaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a \ncouple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit \nslow, pre-occupied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just\n put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nsouthern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nmistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and \nTwilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to \nsee any of her friends in such a state.\nHowever, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d \nthought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit \nbetter, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, \nand pulled away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay. Her voice was layered with trembles, immersed in despondency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n stepped towards Applejack once again, attempting to embrace her, yet, \nbefore she could even make contact, Applejack pulled away, mimicking her\n own earlier actions. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust leave it, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hurt, but irritable. However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all \nTwilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye \ncontact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.\nTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there \nwas little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to \nrespect her wishes.\nShe could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at \nthat, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.\n\nTrying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move \ntowards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was \nundoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. \nAs Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99\nThis seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really \napply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were \nattending.\n\nWhen the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight\n was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, \nbanners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party. However, something\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite right.\n\nTwilight stood in the doorway for a moment, with Applejack reluctantly in tow, \nuntil she could put her hoof on what was feeling amiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia! Mrs Cake! Are you alright?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs Cake was laid on the floor, among the party detritus, below a banner that read \xe2\x80\x9cPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s Pony-fabulous Party!\xe2\x80\x9d  She clung to a piece of paper, pouring her tears into it.\n\nStuttering through tears, Mrs Cake mumbled into the paper, inaudible to Twilight. \nMoving closer, Twilight lowered herself down on the floor, levelling \nherself with the morose pony.\nAttempting to give Mrs Cake a comforting pat, Twilight brought her fore-hoof down \non her shoulder, and did her best to make friendly eye contact with the \ntear-stricken pink of Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but they remained fixated upon \nthe content of the paper in front of her.\nIn a softened, consoling tone of voice, Twilight continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Mrs Cake; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear you\xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn-between sobs, Twilight, caught the reason for Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, escaping in \nalmost silent whispers, like she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to pass the words from \nher lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'chapter_number': 8, 'parent_chapter_id': 63, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Gone</h3>\n<p>Twilight hauled her saddlebag on, yet lingered by the door of the library, </p><p>instead of leaving. This was because, due to her eagerness to leave, and</p><p> her exceptional organisational skills, she was once again, ready far </p><p>too early.</p><p>She looked up, back towards the literary forest behind her, and called out to her assistant; Spike.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpike!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight heard the soft padding of Spike\xe2\x80\x99s steps, ricocheting delicately off of </p><p>the bounds of information, upon the shelves of the library. Twilight </p><p>liked how the library\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous nature accentuated such sounds. It was</p><p> as if the books were helping her further than anypony thought they </p><p>actually could, relaying real world sounds to her. </p><p>Nevertheless, even though the sounds of his steps were all too obvious to Twilight, </p><p>Spike refrained from vocalising his movement.</p><p>However, Twilight was kind of expecting this. She suspected that Spike was still</p><p> rather annoyed from having to clean up behind her, and thus, would </p><p>probably try to make a point, and not speak to her for as long as he </p><p>could.</p><p>But, Twilight knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out too long\xe2\x80\xa6 After all, he had to speak to her, Spike was her assistant!</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could see that Spike was trying to sound as dejected as he could, but </p><p>looking at the floor whilst doing so. She was sure that if she could </p><p>make eye contact with her assistant, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably snap out of his act.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party with me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shot up, brightly, away from the forced melancholic stare at the </p><p>ground, apparently forgetting all disdain for having to clean up behind </p><p>Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, Twi\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned, and instead of replying, she just waited for Spike\xe2\x80\x99s next inevitable question.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWill Rarity be there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Even though she knew she\xe2\x80\x99d have this question asked of her, Twilight was </p><p>hoping Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, as then, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be the bringer of </p><p>bad news, and twice in one day, at that! First the horrors of cleaning, </p><p>and now this!</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t I already tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike looked blankly at Twilight, Obviously she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done so. Or perhaps he forgot?</p><p>No, Twilight thought to herself; Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything about Rarity.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, Rarity won\xe2\x80\x99t be there\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike exhaled loudly, disappointedly, and brought his gaze back down to the floor.</p><p>However, Twilight, used to his behaviour, carried on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s away with Fluttershy, on a spa weekend break, I recall her mentioning it last week.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight took a couple of hoofsteps towards Spike, and gave him a quick tap on </p><p>the shoulder, and attempted to act more like the mother figure, instead </p><p>of her normal role.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike looked back up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, with a sad smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Twilight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some cleaning to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight let out a quiet chuckle to herself. Even if Spike didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, he always put a grin on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but Spike, Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99ll be there too!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight immersed herself in thoughts of Rainbow, reminiscing just from the </p><p>combination of her name rolling off of her own tongue, mingling with her</p><p> left over scent, still lingering from the night before.</p><p>Twilight just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see Rainbow, even if Pinkie Pie and Applejack were to be at the party too, Twilight was sure she could have Rainbow to herself, for the most part, anyway. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why do you keep mentioning Rainbow Dash? Other ponies will be there too, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a tad embarrassed, again, but managed to hold out on any blush, </p><p>this time. How had she managed to let Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s name slip out twice!? </p><p>Not that Twilight thought that she ought to hide what she thought the two </p><p>fillies had together. No, she wanted to run around Ponyville, declaring </p><p>her love for Rainbow. Twilight wanted everypony to know.</p><p class="double">However, Twilight knew two things, both drawn from her time reading romance </p><p>novels. The first was that, in these novels, it was apparent that most </p><p>of the couples would wait to announce their relationship together, and </p><p>Twilight wanted to be gracious, and give Rainbow that opportunity.</p><p>The second was that, had Twilight done so, the whole thing would\xe2\x80\x99ve been horribly clich\xc3\xa9.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Spike, look at the time! I\xe2\x80\x99d best be off!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight knew she still had a few more minutes until she was actually scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp;to leave, but she\xe2\x80\x99d decided that it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be the best to leave early, after all, it meant she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to figure out how to vocalise all these thoughts in her head, and then find a way to convey it so Spike would understand it.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Due to instinct, Rainbow Dash had headed straight home. </p><p>Yet,</p><p> as she lay, sprawled upon her cloud sofa, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel </p><p>that her relaxation was merely synthesised. Although, at heart, Rainbow </p><p>wanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew</p><p> that she was far from able to do such a thing. </p><p>The fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.</p><p class="double">Of course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny</p><p> little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.</p><p> Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the </p><p>two conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>brain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.</p><p>Still, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the </p><p>wound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, </p><p>Rainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.</p><p>That\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Thinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>going to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that </p><p>was somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.</p><p>No, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.</p><p class="double">Asmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make </p><p>amends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage </p><p>Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. </p><p>But even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?</p><p>Without her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.</p><p class="double">Yes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. </p><p>Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be</p><p> itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. </p><p class="double">Twilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the </p><p>reason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without </p><p>knowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no </p><p>reason for her to hide it.</p><p class="double">Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, </p><p>nevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>probably know everything.</p><p>Well, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.</p><p class="double">Anyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.</p><p class="double">She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Applejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, </p><p>yet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>pulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or </p><p>rather, her eyes.</p><p class="double"> Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was </p><p>to it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, </p><p>to cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving </p><p>below her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to </p><p>Sugarcube Corner.</p><p>She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably</p><p> wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew </p><p>that she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.</p><p class="double">When Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her </p><p>brother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, </p><p>pondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always </p><p>trying to look cool, all the time.</p><p>Yet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. </p><p class="double">Not that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. </p><p class="double">Applejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash </p><p>was nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own </p><p>neck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just </p><p>listened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she </p><p>loved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. </p><p>However, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not </p><p>yet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>dependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.</p><p class="double">Even though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular </p><p>enough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.</p><p class="double">Although the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that</p><p> she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone </p><p>wrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that </p><p>she wanted to try.</p><p>The last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not</p><p> have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have </p><p>been just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.</p><p class="double">Applejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her </p><p>destination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite </p><p>direction. A purple filly.</p><p class="double">As Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards </p><p>her, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed </p><p>on to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>thoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I really am, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWith Twilight\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight Sparkle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain her joy; it was only moments from her arrival at the party, she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to see Rainbow again!</p><p class="double">Escaping from her runaway scenarios in her head, Twilight began to focus back </p><p>onto the real world, after all, she was nearly at Sugarcube Corner, and </p><p>needed to pay attention to walking, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trot into </p><p>anything.</p><p class="double">As Twilight looked towards the entrance of the store, she could not only </p><p>see the ornate cakey exterior of Sugarcube Corner, but the contrasting </p><p>orange of Applejack, waiting by the door, looking to the ground.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight called out loudly, yet she got no response. Applejack just kept gazing </p><p>into the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps </p><p>Applejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.</p><p class="double">Reaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">At first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a </p><p>couple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit </p><p>slow, pre-occupied.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="double">Applejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just</p><p> put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>southern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have </p><p>mistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and </p><p>Twilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to </p><p>see any of her friends in such a state.</p><p>However, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>thought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit </p><p>better, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, </p><p>and pulled away.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">There was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay.

However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all </p><p>Twilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye </p><p>contact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.</p><p>Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there </p><p>was little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to </p><p>respect her wishes.</p><p>She could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at </p><p>that, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.</p><p class="double">Trying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move </p><p>towards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was </p><p>undoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. </p><p>As Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>This seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really </p><p>apply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were </p><p>attending.</p><p class="double">When the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight</p><p> was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, </p><p>banners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party. However, something</p><p> didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite right.</p><p class="double">Twilight stood in the doorway for a moment, with Applejack reluctantly in tow, </p><p>until she could put her hoof on what was feeling amiss.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia! Mrs Cake! Are you alright?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Mrs Cake was laid on the floor, among the party detritus, below a banner that read \xe2\x80\x9cPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s Pony-fabulous Party!\xe2\x80\x9d&nbsp;&nbsp;She clung to a piece of paper, pouring her tears into it.</p><p class="double">Stuttering through tears, Mrs Cake mumbled into the paper, inaudible to Twilight. </p><p>Moving closer, Twilight lowered herself down on the floor, levelling </p><p>herself with the morose pony.</p><p>Attempting to give Mrs Cake a comforting pat, Twilight brought her fore-hoof down </p><p>on her shoulder, and did her best to make friendly eye contact with the </p><p>tear-stricken pink of Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but they remained fixated upon </p><p>the content of the paper in front of her.</p><p>In a softened, consoling tone of voice, Twilight continued.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Mrs Cake; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear you\xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">In-between sobs, Twilight, caught the reason for Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, escaping in </p><p>almost silent whispers, like she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to pass the words from </p><p>her lips.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 15}, 'chapter_id': 63, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x030147B0>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Gone</h3>\n<p>Twilight hauled her saddlebag on, yet lingered by the door of the library, </p><p>instead of leaving. This was because, due to her eagerness to leave, and</p><p> her exceptional organisational skills, she was once again, ready far </p><p>too early.</p><p>She looked up, back towards the literary forest behind her, and called out to her assistant; Spike.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpike!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight heard the soft padding of Spike\xe2\x80\x99s steps, ricocheting delicately off of </p><p>the bounds of information, upon the shelves of the library. Twilight </p><p>liked how the library\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous nature accentuated such sounds. It was</p><p> as if the books were helping her further than anypony thought they </p><p>actually could, relaying real world sounds to her. </p><p>Nevertheless, even though the sounds of his steps were all too obvious to Twilight, </p><p>Spike refrained from vocalising his movement.</p><p>However, Twilight was kind of expecting this. She suspected that Spike was still</p><p> rather annoyed from having to clean up behind her, and thus, would </p><p>probably try to make a point, and not speak to her for as long as he </p><p>could.</p><p>But, Twilight knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out too long\xe2\x80\xa6 After all, he had to speak to her, Spike was her assistant!</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight could see that Spike was trying to sound as dejected as he could, but </p><p>looking at the floor whilst doing so. She was sure that if she could </p><p>make eye contact with her assistant, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably snap out of his act.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party with me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shot up, brightly, away from the forced melancholic stare at the </p><p>ground, apparently forgetting all disdain for having to clean up behind </p><p>Twilight.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, Twi\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned, and instead of replying, she just waited for Spike\xe2\x80\x99s next inevitable question.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWill Rarity be there?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Even though she knew she\xe2\x80\x99d have this question asked of her, Twilight was </p><p>hoping Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, as then, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be the bringer of </p><p>bad news, and twice in one day, at that! First the horrors of cleaning, </p><p>and now this!</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t I already tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike looked blankly at Twilight, Obviously she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done so. Or perhaps he forgot?</p><p>No, Twilight thought to herself; Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything about Rarity.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, Rarity won\xe2\x80\x99t be there\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike exhaled loudly, disappointedly, and brought his gaze back down to the floor.</p><p>However, Twilight, used to his behaviour, carried on.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s away with Fluttershy, on a spa weekend break, I recall her mentioning it last week.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight took a couple of hoofsteps towards Spike, and gave him a quick tap on </p><p>the shoulder, and attempted to act more like the mother figure, instead </p><p>of her normal role.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Spike looked back up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, with a sad smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Twilight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some cleaning to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight let out a quiet chuckle to herself. Even if Spike didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, he always put a grin on her face.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but Spike, Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99ll be there too!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight immersed herself in thoughts of Rainbow, reminiscing just from the </p><p>combination of her name rolling off of her own tongue, mingling with her</p><p> left over scent, still lingering from the night before.</p><p>Twilight just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see Rainbow, even if Pinkie Pie and Applejack were to be at the party too, Twilight was sure she could have Rainbow to herself, for the most part, anyway. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why do you keep mentioning Rainbow Dash? Other ponies will be there too, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a tad embarrassed, again, but managed to hold out on any blush, </p><p>this time. How had she managed to let Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s name slip out twice!? </p><p>Not that Twilight thought that she ought to hide what she thought the two </p><p>fillies had together. No, she wanted to run around Ponyville, declaring </p><p>her love for Rainbow. Twilight wanted everypony to know.</p><p class="double">However, Twilight knew two things, both drawn from her time reading romance </p><p>novels. The first was that, in these novels, it was apparent that most </p><p>of the couples would wait to announce their relationship together, and </p><p>Twilight wanted to be gracious, and give Rainbow that opportunity.</p><p>The second was that, had Twilight done so, the whole thing would\xe2\x80\x99ve been horribly clich\xc3\xa9.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Spike, look at the time! I\xe2\x80\x99d best be off!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight knew she still had a few more minutes until she was actually scheduled&nbsp;&nbsp;to leave, but she\xe2\x80\x99d decided that it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be the best to leave early, after all, it meant she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to figure out how to vocalise all these thoughts in her head, and then find a way to convey it so Spike would understand it.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double"></p><p>Due to instinct, Rainbow Dash had headed straight home. </p><p>Yet,</p><p> as she lay, sprawled upon her cloud sofa, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel </p><p>that her relaxation was merely synthesised. Although, at heart, Rainbow </p><p>wanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew</p><p> that she was far from able to do such a thing. </p><p>The fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.</p><p class="double">Of course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny</p><p> little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.</p><p> Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the </p><p>two conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>brain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.</p><p>Still, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the </p><p>wound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, </p><p>Rainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.</p><p>That\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Thinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>going to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that </p><p>was somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.</p><p>No, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.</p><p class="double">Asmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make </p><p>amends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage </p><p>Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. </p><p>But even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?</p><p>Without her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.</p><p class="double">Yes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. </p><p>Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be</p><p> itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. </p><p class="double">Twilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the </p><p>reason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without </p><p>knowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no </p><p>reason for her to hide it.</p><p class="double">Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, </p><p>nevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>probably know everything.</p><p>Well, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.</p><p class="double">Anyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.</p><p class="double">She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Applejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, </p><p>yet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>pulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or </p><p>rather, her eyes.</p><p class="double"> Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was </p><p>to it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, </p><p>to cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving </p><p>below her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to </p><p>Sugarcube Corner.</p><p>She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably</p><p> wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew </p><p>that she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.</p><p class="double">When Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her </p><p>brother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, </p><p>pondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always </p><p>trying to look cool, all the time.</p><p>Yet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. </p><p class="double">Not that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. </p><p class="double">Applejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash </p><p>was nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own </p><p>neck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just </p><p>listened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she </p><p>loved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. </p><p>However, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not </p><p>yet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>dependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.</p><p class="double">Even though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular </p><p>enough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.</p><p class="double">Although the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that</p><p> she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone </p><p>wrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that </p><p>she wanted to try.</p><p>The last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not</p><p> have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have </p><p>been just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.</p><p class="double">Applejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her </p><p>destination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite </p><p>direction. A purple filly.</p><p class="double">As Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards </p><p>her, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed </p><p>on to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>thoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I really am, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cWith Twilight\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight Sparkle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain her joy; it was only moments from her arrival at the party, she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to see Rainbow again!</p><p class="double">Escaping from her runaway scenarios in her head, Twilight began to focus back </p><p>onto the real world, after all, she was nearly at Sugarcube Corner, and </p><p>needed to pay attention to walking, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trot into </p><p>anything.</p><p class="double">As Twilight looked towards the entrance of the store, she could not only </p><p>see the ornate cakey exterior of Sugarcube Corner, but the contrasting </p><p>orange of Applejack, waiting by the door, looking to the ground.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight called out loudly, yet she got no response. Applejack just kept gazing </p><p>into the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps </p><p>Applejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.</p><p class="double">Reaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">At first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a </p><p>couple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit </p><p>slow, pre-occupied.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="double">Applejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just</p><p> put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>southern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have </p><p>mistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and </p><p>Twilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to </p><p>see any of her friends in such a state.</p><p>However, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>thought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit </p><p>better, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, </p><p>and pulled away.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">There was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay. Her voice was layered with trembles, immersed in despondency.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> stepped towards Applejack once again, attempting to embrace her, yet, </p><p>before she could even make contact, Applejack pulled away, mimicking her</p><p> own earlier actions. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cJust leave it, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hurt, but irritable. However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all </p><p>Twilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye </p><p>contact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.</p><p>Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there </p><p>was little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to </p><p>respect her wishes.</p><p>She could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at </p><p>that, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.</p><p class="double">Trying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move </p><p>towards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was </p><p>undoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. </p><p>As Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>This seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really </p><p>apply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were </p><p>attending.</p><p class="double">When the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight</p><p> was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, </p><p>banners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party.

This was because, due to her eagerness to leave, and\n her exceptional organisational skills, she was once again, ready far \ntoo early.\nShe looked up, back towards the literary forest behind her, and called out to her assistant; Spike.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight heard the soft padding of Spike\xe2\x80\x99s steps, ricocheting delicately off of \nthe bounds of information, upon the shelves of the library. Twilight \nliked how the library\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous nature accentuated such sounds. It was\n as if the books were helping her further than anypony thought they \nactually could, relaying real world sounds to her. \nNevertheless, even though the sounds of his steps were all too obvious to Twilight, \nSpike refrained from vocalising his movement.\nHowever, Twilight was kind of expecting this. She suspected that Spike was still\n rather annoyed from having to clean up behind her, and thus, would \nprobably try to make a point, and not speak to her for as long as he \ncould.\nBut, Twilight knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out too long\xe2\x80\xa6 After all, he had to speak to her, Spike was her assistant!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could see that Spike was trying to sound as dejected as he could, but \nlooking at the floor whilst doing so. She was sure that if she could \nmake eye contact with her assistant, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably snap out of his act.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shot up, brightly, away from the forced melancholic stare at the \nground, apparently forgetting all disdain for having to clean up behind \nTwilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, Twi\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight grinned, and instead of replying, she just waited for Spike\xe2\x80\x99s next inevitable question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Rarity be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven though she knew she\xe2\x80\x99d have this question asked of her, Twilight was \nhoping Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, as then, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be the bringer of \nbad news, and twice in one day, at that! First the horrors of cleaning, \nand now this!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t I already tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike looked blankly at Twilight, Obviously she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done so. Or perhaps he forgot?\nNo, Twilight thought to herself; Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget anything about Rarity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike, Rarity won\xe2\x80\x99t be there\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike exhaled loudly, disappointedly, and brought his gaze back down to the floor.\nHowever, Twilight, used to his behaviour, carried on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s away with Fluttershy, on a spa weekend break, I recall her mentioning it last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight took a couple of hoofsteps towards Spike, and gave him a quick tap on \nthe shoulder, and attempted to act more like the mother figure, instead \nof her normal role.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Spike\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike looked back up to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, with a sad smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Twilight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some cleaning to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight let out a quiet chuckle to herself. Even if Spike didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, he always put a grin on her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but Spike, Rainbow Dash\xe2\x80\x99ll be there too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight immersed herself in thoughts of Rainbow, reminiscing just from the \ncombination of her name rolling off of her own tongue, mingling with her\n left over scent, still lingering from the night before.\nTwilight just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see Rainbow, even if Pinkie Pie and Applejack were to be at the party too, Twilight was sure she could have Rainbow to herself, for the most part, anyway. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, why do you keep mentioning Rainbow Dash? Other ponies will be there too, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight felt a tad embarrassed, again, but managed to hold out on any blush, \nthis time. How had she managed to let Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s name slip out twice!? \nNot that Twilight thought that she ought to hide what she thought the two \nfillies had together. No, she wanted to run around Ponyville, declaring \nher love for Rainbow. Twilight wanted everypony to know.\n\nHowever, Twilight knew two things, both drawn from her time reading romance \nnovels. The first was that, in these novels, it was apparent that most \nof the couples would wait to announce their relationship together, and \nTwilight wanted to be gracious, and give Rainbow that opportunity.\nThe second was that, had Twilight done so, the whole thing would\xe2\x80\x99ve been horribly clich\xc3\xa9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Spike, look at the time! I\xe2\x80\x99d best be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight knew she still had a few more minutes until she was actually scheduled  to leave, but she\xe2\x80\x99d decided that it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be the best to leave early, after all, it meant she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to figure out how to vocalise all these thoughts in her head, and then find a way to convey it so Spike would understand it.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nDue to instinct, Rainbow Dash had headed straight home. \nYet,\n as she lay, sprawled upon her cloud sofa, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel \nthat her relaxation was merely synthesised. Although, at heart, Rainbow \nwanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew\n that she was far from able to do such a thing. \nThe fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.\n\nOf course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny\n little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.\n Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the \ntwo conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nbrain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.\nStill, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the \nwound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, \nRainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.\n\nThinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \ngoing to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that \nwas somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.\nNo, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.\n\nAsmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make \namends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. \nBut even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?\nWithout her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.\n\nYes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. \nRainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be\n itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. \n\nTwilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the \nreason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without \nknowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no \nreason for her to hide it.\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, \nnevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d \nprobably know everything.\nWell, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.\n\nAnyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nApplejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, \nyet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d \npulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or \nrather, her eyes.\n\n Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was \nto it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, \nto cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving \nbelow her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to \nSugarcube Corner.\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably\n wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew \nthat she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.\n\nWhen Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her \nbrother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, \npondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always \ntrying to look cool, all the time.\nYet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. \n\nNot that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. \n\nApplejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash \nwas nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own \nneck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just \nlistened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she \nloved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. \nHowever, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not \nyet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \ndependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.\n\nEven though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular \nenough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.\n\nAlthough the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that\n she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone \nwrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that \nshe wanted to try.\nThe last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not\n have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have \nbeen just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.\n\nApplejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her \ndestination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite \ndirection. A purple filly.\n\nAs Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards \nher, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed \non to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nthoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I really am, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Twilight\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain her joy; it was only moments from her arrival at the party, she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to see Rainbow again!\n\nEscaping from her runaway scenarios in her head, Twilight began to focus back \nonto the real world, after all, she was nearly at Sugarcube Corner, and \nneeded to pay attention to walking, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trot into \nanything.\n\nAs Twilight looked towards the entrance of the store, she could not only \nsee the ornate cakey exterior of Sugarcube Corner, but the contrasting \norange of Applejack, waiting by the door, looking to the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight called out loudly, yet she got no response. Applejack just kept gazing \ninto the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps \nApplejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.\n\nReaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a \ncouple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit \nslow, pre-occupied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just\n put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nsouthern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nmistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and \nTwilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to \nsee any of her friends in such a state.\nHowever, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d \nthought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit \nbetter, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, \nand pulled away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay. Her voice was layered with trembles, immersed in despondency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n stepped towards Applejack once again, attempting to embrace her, yet, \nbefore she could even make contact, Applejack pulled away, mimicking her\n own earlier actions. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust leave it, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hurt, but irritable. However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all \nTwilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye \ncontact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.\nTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there \nwas little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to \nrespect her wishes.\nShe could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at \nthat, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.\n\nTrying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move \ntowards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was \nundoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. \nAs Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99\nThis seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really \napply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were \nattending.\n\nWhen the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight\n was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, \nbanners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party. However, something\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite right.\n\nTwilight stood in the doorway for a moment, with Applejack reluctantly in tow, \nuntil she could put her hoof on what was feeling amiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia! Mrs Cake! Are you alright?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs Cake was laid on the floor, among the party detritus, below a banner that read \xe2\x80\x9cPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s Pony-fabulous Party!\xe2\x80\x9d  She clung to a piece of paper, pouring her tears into it.\n\nStuttering through tears, Mrs Cake mumbled into the paper, inaudible to Twilight. \nMoving closer, Twilight lowered herself down on the floor, levelling \nherself with the morose pony.\nAttempting to give Mrs Cake a comforting pat, Twilight brought her fore-hoof down \non her shoulder, and did her best to make friendly eye contact with the \ntear-stricken pink of Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but they remained fixated upon \nthe content of the paper in front of her.\nIn a softened, consoling tone of voice, Twilight continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Mrs Cake; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear you\xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn-between sobs, Twilight, caught the reason for Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, escaping in \nalmost silent whispers, like she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to pass the words from \nher lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d', 8, 63, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'8\'></a><h3>Gone</h3>\n<p>Twilight hauled her saddlebag on, yet lingered by the door of the library, </p><p>instead of leaving.

Although, at heart, Rainbow </p><p>wanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew</p><p> that she was far from able to do such a thing. </p><p>The fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.</p><p class="double">Of course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny</p><p> little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.</p><p> Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the </p><p>two conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>brain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.</p><p>Still, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the </p><p>wound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, </p><p>Rainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.</p><p>That\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Thinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t </p><p>going to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that </p><p>was somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.</p><p>No, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.</p><p class="double">Asmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make </p><p>amends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that </p><p>Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage </p><p>Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. </p><p>But even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?</p><p>Without her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.</p><p class="double">Yes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. </p><p>Rainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be</p><p> itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. </p><p class="double">Twilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the </p><p>reason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without </p><p>knowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no </p><p>reason for her to hide it.</p><p class="double">Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, </p><p>nevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>probably know everything.</p><p>Well, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.</p><p class="double">Anyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.</p><p class="double">She still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">*****</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Applejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, </p><p>yet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>pulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or </p><p>rather, her eyes.</p><p class="double"> Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was </p><p>to it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, </p><p>to cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving </p><p>below her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to </p><p>Sugarcube Corner.</p><p>She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably</p><p> wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew </p><p>that she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.</p><p class="double">When Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her </p><p>brother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, </p><p>pondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always </p><p>trying to look cool, all the time.</p><p>Yet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. </p><p class="double">Not that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. </p><p class="double">Applejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash </p><p>was nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own </p><p>neck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just </p><p>listened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she </p><p>loved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. </p><p>However, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not </p><p>yet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>dependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.</p><p class="double">Even though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular </p><p>enough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.</p><p class="double">Although the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that</p><p> she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone </p><p>wrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that </p><p>she wanted to try.</p><p>The last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not</p><p> have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have </p><p>been just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.</p><p class="double">Applejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her </p><p>destination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite </p><p>direction. A purple filly.</p><p class="double">As Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards </p><p>her, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed </p><p>on to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>thoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.

Applejack just kept gazing </p><p>into the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps </p><p>Applejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.</p><p class="double">Reaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">At first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a </p><p>couple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit </p><p>slow, pre-occupied.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p class="double">Applejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just</p><p> put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s </p><p>southern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have </p><p>mistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and </p><p>Twilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to </p><p>see any of her friends in such a state.</p><p>However, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d </p><p>thought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit </p><p>better, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, </p><p>and pulled away.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">There was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay. Her voice was layered with trembles, immersed in despondency.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Twilight</p><p> stepped towards Applejack once again, attempting to embrace her, yet, </p><p>before she could even make contact, Applejack pulled away, mimicking her</p><p> own earlier actions. </p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cJust leave it, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hurt, but irritable. However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all </p><p>Twilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye </p><p>contact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.</p><p>Twilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there </p><p>was little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to </p><p>respect her wishes.</p><p>She could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at </p><p>that, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.</p><p class="double">Trying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move </p><p>towards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was </p><p>undoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. </p><p>As Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>This seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really </p><p>apply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were </p><p>attending.</p><p class="double">When the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight</p><p> was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, </p><p>banners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party. However, something</p><p> didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite right.</p><p class="double">Twilight stood in the doorway for a moment, with Applejack reluctantly in tow, </p><p>until she could put her hoof on what was feeling amiss.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia! Mrs Cake! Are you alright?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">Mrs Cake was laid on the floor, among the party detritus, below a banner that read \xe2\x80\x9cPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s Pony-fabulous Party!\xe2\x80\x9d&nbsp;&nbsp;She clung to a piece of paper, pouring her tears into it.</p><p class="double">Stuttering through tears, Mrs Cake mumbled into the paper, inaudible to Twilight. </p><p>Moving closer, Twilight lowered herself down on the floor, levelling </p><p>herself with the morose pony.</p><p>Attempting to give Mrs Cake a comforting pat, Twilight brought her fore-hoof down </p><p>on her shoulder, and did her best to make friendly eye contact with the </p><p>tear-stricken pink of Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but they remained fixated upon </p><p>the content of the paper in front of her.</p><p>In a softened, consoling tone of voice, Twilight continued.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Mrs Cake; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear you\xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="double">In-between sobs, Twilight, caught the reason for Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, escaping in </p><p>almost silent whispers, like she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to pass the words from </p><p>her lips.</p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 15], 'parent_story_id': 15, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// Gone// Story: With a Heavy Heart// by Krypqe//------------------------------//\n\nTwilight hauled her saddlebag on, yet lingered by the door of the library, \ninstead of leaving. This was because, due to her eagerness to leave, and\n her exceptional organisational skills, she was once again, ready far \ntoo early.\nShe looked up, back towards the literary forest behind her, and called out to her assistant; Spike.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpike!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight heard the soft padding of Spike\xe2\x80\x99s steps, ricocheting delicately off of \nthe bounds of information, upon the shelves of the library. Twilight \nliked how the library\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous nature accentuated such sounds. It was\n as if the books were helping her further than anypony thought they \nactually could, relaying real world sounds to her. \nNevertheless, even though the sounds of his steps were all too obvious to Twilight, \nSpike refrained from vocalising his movement.\nHowever, Twilight was kind of expecting this. She suspected that Spike was still\n rather annoyed from having to clean up behind her, and thus, would \nprobably try to make a point, and not speak to her for as long as he \ncould.\nBut, Twilight knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out too long\xe2\x80\xa6 After all, he had to speak to her, Spike was her assistant!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight could see that Spike was trying to sound as dejected as he could, but \nlooking at the floor whilst doing so. She was sure that if she could \nmake eye contact with her assistant, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably snap out of his act.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpike\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shot up, brightly, away from the forced melancholic stare at the \nground, apparently forgetting all disdain for having to clean up behind \nTwilight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, Twi\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight grinned, and instead of replying, she just waited for Spike\xe2\x80\x99s next inevitable question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Rarity be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven though she knew she\xe2\x80\x99d have this question asked of her, Twilight was \nhoping Spike wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, as then, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to be the bringer of \nbad news, and twice in one day, at that!

How had she managed to let Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s name slip out twice!? \nNot that Twilight thought that she ought to hide what she thought the two \nfillies had together. No, she wanted to run around Ponyville, declaring \nher love for Rainbow. Twilight wanted everypony to know.\n\nHowever, Twilight knew two things, both drawn from her time reading romance \nnovels. The first was that, in these novels, it was apparent that most \nof the couples would wait to announce their relationship together, and \nTwilight wanted to be gracious, and give Rainbow that opportunity.\nThe second was that, had Twilight done so, the whole thing would\xe2\x80\x99ve been horribly clich\xc3\xa9.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Spike, look at the time! I\xe2\x80\x99d best be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight knew she still had a few more minutes until she was actually scheduled  to leave, but she\xe2\x80\x99d decided that it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be the best to leave early, after all, it meant she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to figure out how to vocalise all these thoughts in her head, and then find a way to convey it so Spike would understand it.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nDue to instinct, Rainbow Dash had headed straight home. \nYet,\n as she lay, sprawled upon her cloud sofa, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel \nthat her relaxation was merely synthesised. Although, at heart, Rainbow \nwanted nothing other than to be able to exist, to have it easy, she knew\n that she was far from able to do such a thing. \nThe fillies that were running around within her brain were making sure of that.\n\nOf course, Rainbow knew that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually tiny\n little ponies running around her head, but it sure felt like it to her.\n Not only due to the bizarre concoction of affection and animosity the \ntwo conflicting fillies managed to somehow create within Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s \nbrain, but because it felt like they were trying to dig their way out of her skull.\nStill, Rainbow was aware that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the case, although the \nwound upon her forehead had been conceived with one of the two ponies, \nRainbow was adamant that such a scenario would never occur.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy on a level higher than Pinkie Pie.\n\nThinking of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow had already made the decision that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \ngoing to attend her party. Not because of Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s craziness, no, that \nwas somewhat of a draw for Rainbow; it was fun, for a while, anyway.\nNo, the reasons behind her want for being alone were, yet again, Twilight Sparkle and Applejack.\n\nAsmuch as Rainbow would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to meet up with Applejack, and make \namends, or to as much as an extent as she could, Rainbow knew that \nTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence would hinder that; and possibly even damage \nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s and her own relation ship beyond repair. \nBut even if Rainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, would Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s encounter without her harbour even more problems?\nWithout her there, Twilight might stumble into problems with Applejack.\n\nYes, Twilight was a clever pony, but even she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t learned of the relationship between Applejack and Rainbow Dash, and, with this in mind, she could potentially ruin everything. \nRainbow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an idiot, and she knew Twilight. She knew that Twilight would be\n itching to tell everypony about their newly formed bonds. Not because Twilight liked to brag, or because she wanted to gossip, but merely because Twilight would be happy. \n\nTwilight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide her happiness. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d want to spread the \nreason for her happiness, so everypony could feel it, too, and without \nknowledge of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Rainbow Dash, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no \nreason for her to hide it.\n\nRainbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Applejack knew of her night with Twilight, \nnevertheless, Rainbow knew that after their imminent meeting, she\xe2\x80\x99d \nprobably know everything.\nWell, perhaps not everything. Rainbow hoped that Twilight would at least be a bit prudish with some of the details. Even though Twilight was smart, her naiveties within love could lead to revelations of more intimate scenes. However, Rainbow Dash supposed that not even Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s naivety stretched to describing such\xe2\x80\xa6 Scenes.\n\nAnyway, even though the whole situation seemed incredibly daunting for Rainbow, without any certainties to rely on, she knew one thing.\n\nShe still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nApplejack could still feel the cool breeze, carried down from Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill, \nyet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t ruffle her mane as much as it could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, as she\xe2\x80\x99d \npulled her Stetson down tightly, in an attempt to cover her face. Or \nrather, her eyes.\n\n Applejack knew it was silly, if she was upset, that was all there was \nto it, why bother hiding it? Yet, it had seemed the right thing to do, \nto cover up her red, puffy eyes. She looked down at the floor, moving \nbelow her, as she absent mindedly, slowly clopped her way over to \nSugarcube Corner.\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really wanted to go, in fact, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped crying, Applejack probably\n wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s hill at all. However, Applejack knew \nthat she had to go; after all, there was at least a small chance that Dash would be there, and Applejack desperately needed to see her.\n\nWhen Dash had left her upon the hill, Applejack hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned to help her \nbrother, like she\xe2\x80\x99d said she would. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99d just remained, \npondering. Wondering why Dash had continued to be like she was, always \ntrying to look cool, all the time.\nYet, to Applejack, it was apparent that this \xe2\x80\x98keeping up\xe2\x80\x99 of appearances seemed to only apply to the relationship surrounding Dash and herself. \n\nNot that Applejack would\xe2\x80\x99ve realised this, had Dash not told her herself. \n\nApplejack played back the groggy scenes from the night before, in her head: Dash \nwas nuzzling her, burying her tearful eyes into the orange of her own \nneck, warming. Yet again, like their times before, Applejack had just \nlistened, absorbing Dash\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, desperate to make the pony she \nloved feel \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 again. \nHowever, try as she might, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Dash for her actions, not \nyet, anyway. Despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn upset, and despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \ndependability, her forgiveness, it would take a while for Dash to get the catharsis she so desperately desired.\n\nEven though Dash was full of apologies, none of them were quite spectacular \nenough to compensate for what she\xe2\x80\x99d broken in to confess to Applejack.\n\nAlthough the fact that Dash was willing to make an effort to confess showed that\n she still had feelings for Applejack, and she knew where she\xe2\x80\x99d gone \nwrong, it still didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix what she\xe2\x80\x99d done wrong, but only showed that \nshe wanted to try.\nThe last variable was what pained Applejack. The variable that Dash may not\n have even meant to come and confess to her at all; it may well have \nbeen just the alcohol in her bloodstream that had taken over.\n\nApplejack stole a glance upwards, and realised that she was nearing her \ndestination, Sugarcube Corner, as was another pony, from the opposite \ndirection. A purple filly.\n\nAs Applejack gazed forwards at Twilight Sparkle, trotting gently towards \nher, she remembered, once more, the words that Rainbow Dash had passed \non to her the night before, the words that had clouded Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nthoughts ever since she\xe2\x80\x99d heard them; repeating, constantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I really am, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Twilight\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain her joy; it was only moments from her arrival at the party, she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to see Rainbow again!\n\nEscaping from her runaway scenarios in her head, Twilight began to focus back \nonto the real world, after all, she was nearly at Sugarcube Corner, and \nneeded to pay attention to walking, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trot into \nanything.\n\nAs Twilight looked towards the entrance of the store, she could not only \nsee the ornate cakey exterior of Sugarcube Corner, but the contrasting \norange of Applejack, waiting by the door, looking to the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight called out loudly, yet she got no response. Applejack just kept gazing \ninto the ground, seemingly unaware of Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Perhaps \nApplejack just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, Twilight thought. It was rather blustery, and that could\xe2\x80\x99ve just overwhelmed her voice, despite how loud she called out.\n\nReaching the entrance of Sugarcube Corner, Twilight sidled up to Applejack, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt first, Twilight thought Applejack was just ignoring her, yet, as a \ncouple of seconds went by, it was clear that she was just being a bit \nslow, pre-occupied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Hi, Twi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nApplejack sounded rather dejected, to Twilight. Initially, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve just\n put the tone of voice down to an accidental slip in Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s \nsouthern drawl, yet after reading her gait, Twilight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have \nmistaken Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s apparent emotions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack, are you okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight nuzzled up to Applejack, she was clearly in a state of upset, and \nTwilight wanted to fix that; Applejack was her friend, and she hated to \nsee any of her friends in such a state.\nHowever, something then happened that Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting; whilst she\xe2\x80\x99d \nthought that nuzzling Applejack would help her to feel at least a bit \nbetter, instead of returning the embrace, Applejack shrugged her off, \nand pulled away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was that tone again, Applejack certainly was not okay. Her voice was layered with trembles, immersed in despondency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApplejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwilight\n stepped towards Applejack once again, attempting to embrace her, yet, \nbefore she could even make contact, Applejack pulled away, mimicking her\n own earlier actions. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust leave it, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hurt, but irritable. However, this time, tone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all \nTwilight had to go on, as Applejack looked up to her, making eye \ncontact, with a pleading gaze, through clouded irises.\nTwilight didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but if Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, there \nwas little she could do, Applejack was her friend, and she wanted to \nrespect her wishes.\nShe could have responded, but Twilight thought it was best to leave it at \nthat, with an affirmative silence in place of an answer.\n\nTrying to move on from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy, Twilight decided to move \ntowards the front door of Sugarcube Corner, ready to brave what was \nundoubtedly going to be a rather over the top welcome from Pinkie Pie. \nAs Twilight reached forwards to push open the door, she noticed that the sign on the door read \xe2\x80\x98closed.\xe2\x80\x99\nThis seemed slightly odd, but Twilight assumed that the sign didn\xe2\x80\x99t really \napply to them, and was probably there due to the party they were \nattending.\n\nWhen the door swung open, despite what it\xe2\x80\x99s label tried to profess, Twilight\n was met with an all to familiar sight; streamers, balloons, confetti, \nbanners and all. It was a trademark Pinkie Pie party. However, something\n didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem quite right.\n\nTwilight stood in the doorway for a moment, with Applejack reluctantly in tow, \nuntil she could put her hoof on what was feeling amiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Celestia! Mrs Cake! Are you alright?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs Cake was laid on the floor, among the party detritus, below a banner that read \xe2\x80\x9cPinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s Pony-fabulous Party!\xe2\x80\x9d  She clung to a piece of paper, pouring her tears into it.\n\nStuttering through tears, Mrs Cake mumbled into the paper, inaudible to Twilight. \nMoving closer, Twilight lowered herself down on the floor, levelling \nherself with the morose pony.\nAttempting to give Mrs Cake a comforting pat, Twilight brought her fore-hoof down \non her shoulder, and did her best to make friendly eye contact with the \ntear-stricken pink of Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but they remained fixated upon \nthe content of the paper in front of her.\nIn a softened, consoling tone of voice, Twilight continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Mrs Cake; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear you\xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn-between sobs, Twilight, caught the reason for Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, escaping in \nalmost silent whispers, like she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to pass the words from \nher lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'epub': None}

However, she\xe2\x80\x99d not read a word on the letter for ages, she was staring into it, past the words, to try and find what Pinkie really meant\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tTwilight knew Pinkie, she was her friend. Surely the Pinkie she knew wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tBut Twilight began to wonder, staring into the paper, whether the Pinkie Pie she\xe2\x80\x99d known was Pinkie Pie at all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the not knowing that Pinkie had been hurting that upset Twilight, it was the fact that she had been hurting because of her friends, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed.\n\t\n\tThat, and the friendliest pony she\xe2\x80\x99d ever met; Pinkie Pie, was telling her that \xe2\x80\x98the magic of friendship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as it once appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tFinally, Twilight looked up, from the crumpled, tear smeared words she\xe2\x80\x99d been reading, and upon doing so, realised that she was no longer standing firm like she\xe2\x80\x99d been when she began reading, but collapsed on the floor, curled up in front of Mrs Cake. She could hear Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s heavy breathing from beside her, no doubt caused by Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\t\n\tTwilight sighed, unhappily. It may well have heightened the awkwardness of Sugarcube Corner\xe2\x80\x99s silence, but Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed. Although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific basis behind it, she knew that a sigh could normally alleviate any of her grief.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that this would\xe2\x80\x99ve been true in this situation too, but, her efforts seemed in vain.\n\t\n\tIn fact, to Twilight, it seemed that the thought of a sigh dealing with such important, sensitive things such as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance made the bitter sinking sensation within her a thousand-fold worse.\n\t\n\tTwilight looked across to Mrs Cake, through her slowly clouding eyes, to meet with already cloud-burst ones. Even though the movement of eyes should only take a tiny amount of effort; to Twilight, if felt as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never performed a task more arduous: to meet Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x99s in honesty.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on to Twilight, saying nothing, her forlorn expression speaking in place of words, tears dropping down in place of tone.\n\t\n\tTwilight rifled through her own brain, searching for the perfect words to say \xe2\x80\x93 How do you avoid upsetting somepony in this situation?\n\t\n\tUnable to think, Twilight looked away from Mrs Cake, to Applejack, for support. Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUpon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUnable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tOnce again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAlthough it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.\n\t\n\tEven if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tAll Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tGulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake sighed, again.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\t\n\tTwilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.\n\t\n\tFor the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight shook her head, smiling happily.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tJust before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\tApplejack jumped, gasping suddenly.\n\t\n\tEven though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.\n\t\n\tApplejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?\n\t\n\tAs she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.\n\t\n\tLooking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tNot wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.\n\t\n\tAs the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.\n\t\n\tHowever, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?\n\t\n\tApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.\n\t\n\tFluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.\n\t\n\tRegaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.\n\t\n\tAbsentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.\n\t\n\tApplejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIn truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.\n\t\n\tDespite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.\n\t\n\tHowever, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.\n\t\n\tIt was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.\n\t\n\tWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?\n\t\n\tBut, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.\n\t\n\tThe way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.\n\t\n\tCold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.\n\t\n\tSure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.\n\t\n\tUntil now, that was true.\n\t\n\tNow, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.\n\t\n\tShe just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.\n\t\n\tAs Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.\n\t\n\tShe would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.\n\t\n\tWith her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.\n\t\n\tSounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash smiled, sadly.\n\t\n\tShe knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.\n\t\n\tShe had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.\n\t\n\tBut Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.\n\t\n\tShe was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.\n\t\n\tHowever, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.\n\t\n\tWell, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.\n\t\n\tShe spoke, subdued.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?\n\t\n\tEven without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.\n\t\n\tHowever, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.\n\t\n\tYet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.\n\t\n\tYet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.\n\t\n\tSlowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tEven though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash blinked, confused.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tFor what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.\n\t\n\tPinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?\n\t\n\tWas she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?\n\t\n\tPerhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\n\t\n\tStill, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAgain, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tApplejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.\n\t\n\tShe wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.\n\t\n\tEven so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tPretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.\n\t\n\tShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.\n\t\n\tSometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.\n\t\n\tApplejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.\n\t\n\tBut right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.\n\t\n\tAs the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.\n\t\n\tFalling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t', 'chapter_number': 9, 'parent_chapter_id': 2302, 'chapter_html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'9\'></a><h3>The Ocean Between You and Me</h3>\n<br /><p class="indented"><i></p><p class="indented">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wasting my time, Pinkie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">A lot of ponies tell me this.</p><p class="indented double">I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they mean for it to be as mean as it comes across, but the feelings are still there.</p><p class="indented double">For a time, I just endured this.

Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Upon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Unable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Once again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Although it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.</p><p class="indented double">Even if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.</p><p class="indented double">She\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">All Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">Gulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake sighed, again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="indented double">Twilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.</p><p class="indented double">For the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight shook her head, smiling happily.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Just before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">*****</p><p class="indented double">Applejack jumped, gasping suddenly.</p><p class="indented double">Even though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?</p><p class="indented double">As she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.</p><p class="indented double">Looking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Not wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.</p><p class="indented double">As the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.</p><p class="indented double">However, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?</p><p class="indented double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Regaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.</p><p class="indented double">Absentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">In truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.</p><p class="indented double">However, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.</p><p class="indented double">It was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.</p><p class="indented double">Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?</p><p class="indented double">But, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">The way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.</p><p class="indented double">Cold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.</p><p class="indented double">Sure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.</p><p class="indented double">Until now, that was true.</p><p class="indented double">Now, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.</p><p class="indented double">She just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.</p><p class="indented double">As Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.</p><p class="indented double">She would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.</p><p class="indented double">With her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Sounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Rainbow Dash smiled, sadly.</p><p class="indented double">She knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.</p><p class="indented double">She had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.</p><p class="indented double">But Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.</p><p class="indented double">She was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.</p><p class="indented double">However, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.</p><p class="indented double">Well, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.</p><p class="indented double">She spoke, subdued.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?</p><p class="indented double">Even without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.</p><p class="indented double">However, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.</p><p class="indented double">Yet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.</p><p class="indented double">Yet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Even though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash blinked, confused.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">For what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?</p><p class="indented double">Was she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?</p><p class="indented double">Perhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.</p><p class="indented double">Still, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Again, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Applejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.</p><p class="indented double">She wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.</p><p class="indented double">Even so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Pretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.</p><p class="indented double">She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.</p><p class="indented double">Sometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.</p><p class="indented double">But right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.</p><p class="indented double">As the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.</p><p class="indented double">Falling.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'version': 1, 'parent_story_id': 15}, 'chapter_id': 2302, 'cursor': <mysql.connector.cursor.MySQLCursor object at 0x03014B90>, 'connection': <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x02E01A70>, 'html': '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'9\'></a><h3>The Ocean Between You and Me</h3>\n<br /><p class="indented"><i></p><p class="indented">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wasting my time, Pinkie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">A lot of ponies tell me this.</p><p class="indented double">I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they mean for it to be as mean as it comes across, but the feelings are still there.</p><p class="indented double">For a time, I just endured this. Somehow, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt much when said by ponies I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know.</p><p class="indented double">Then, my friends started saying it.</p><p class="indented double">It hurt.</p><p class="indented double">Did they not trust me? Did they not believe in me?</p><p class="indented double">Did they not love me for who I am?</p><p class="indented double">If I stopped acting as I did, I\xe2\x80\x99d no longer be Pinkie Pie. I\xe2\x80\x99d no longer be the pony you continue to hurt for being who she is.</p><p class="indented double">Do you know what\xe2\x80\x99s worst about it?</p><p class="indented double">My friends; Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed that they\xe2\x80\x99re hurting me.</p><p class="indented double">Is it because my feelings are so unimportant to them?</p><p class="indented double">I thought they might\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, and tried to help, but seemingly, the magic of friendship isn\xe2\x80\x99t really as strong as it once appeared to be.</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake Cup Cake, don\xe2\x80\x99t for a second believe that this is your fault, because, if you do, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be further from the truth.</p><p class="indented double">Your company has been the best thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened to me, and you\xe2\x80\x99re the reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here as long as I have.</p><p class="indented double">Without you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lasted as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve done so.</p><p class="indented double">But, despite that, this is goodbye.</p><p class="indented double">Even though I always feel your love, it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer enough to counter a life in a town that seems to think my time is worth nothing.</p><p class="indented double">If I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll no longer be able to waste everypony\xe2\x80\x99s time.</p><p class="indented double">Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother to tell my friends the others about this.</p><p class="indented double">I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste their time.</p><p class="indented double">-Pinkie</i></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Twilight stared at the letter for what could\xe2\x80\x99ve been hours. However, she\xe2\x80\x99d not read a word on the letter for ages, she was staring into it, past the words, to try and find what Pinkie really meant\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">Twilight knew Pinkie, she was her friend. Surely the Pinkie she knew wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">But Twilight began to wonder, staring into the paper, whether the Pinkie Pie she\xe2\x80\x99d known was Pinkie Pie at all\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the not knowing that Pinkie had been hurting that upset Twilight, it was the fact that she had been hurting because of her friends, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed.</p><p class="indented double">That, and the friendliest pony she\xe2\x80\x99d ever met; Pinkie Pie, was telling her that \xe2\x80\x98the magic of friendship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as it once appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="indented double">Finally, Twilight looked up, from the crumpled, tear smeared words she\xe2\x80\x99d been reading, and upon doing so, realised that she was no longer standing firm like she\xe2\x80\x99d been when she began reading, but collapsed on the floor, curled up in front of Mrs Cake. She could hear Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s heavy breathing from beside her, no doubt caused by Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed, unhappily. It may well have heightened the awkwardness of Sugarcube Corner\xe2\x80\x99s silence, but Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed. Although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific basis behind it, she knew that a sigh could normally alleviate any of her grief.</p><p class="indented double">She\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that this would\xe2\x80\x99ve been true in this situation too, but, her efforts seemed in vain.</p><p class="indented double">In fact, to Twilight, it seemed that the thought of a sigh dealing with such important, sensitive things such as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance made the bitter sinking sensation within her a thousand-fold worse.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked across to Mrs Cake, through her slowly clouding eyes, to meet with already cloud-burst ones. Even though the movement of eyes should only take a tiny amount of effort; to Twilight, if felt as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never performed a task more arduous: to meet Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x99s in honesty.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake looked on to Twilight, saying nothing, her forlorn expression speaking in place of words, tears dropping down in place of tone.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight rifled through her own brain, searching for the perfect words to say \xe2\x80\x93 How do you avoid upsetting somepony in this situation?</p><p class="indented double">Unable to think, Twilight looked away from Mrs Cake, to Applejack, for support. Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Upon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Unable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Once again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Although it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.</p><p class="indented double">Even if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.</p><p class="indented double">She\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">All Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">Gulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake sighed, again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="indented double">Twilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.</p><p class="indented double">For the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight shook her head, smiling happily.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Just before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">*****</p><p class="indented double">Applejack jumped, gasping suddenly.</p><p class="indented double">Even though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?</p><p class="indented double">As she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.</p><p class="indented double">Looking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Not wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.</p><p class="indented double">As the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.</p><p class="indented double">However, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?</p><p class="indented double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Regaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.</p><p class="indented double">Absentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">In truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.</p><p class="indented double">However, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.</p><p class="indented double">It was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.</p><p class="indented double">Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?</p><p class="indented double">But, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">The way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.</p><p class="indented double">Cold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.</p><p class="indented double">Sure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.</p><p class="indented double">Until now, that was true.</p><p class="indented double">Now, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.</p><p class="indented double">She just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.</p><p class="indented double">As Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.</p><p class="indented double">She would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.</p><p class="indented double">With her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Sounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Rainbow Dash smiled, sadly.</p><p class="indented double">She knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.</p><p class="indented double">She had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.</p><p class="indented double">But Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.</p><p class="indented double">She was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.</p><p class="indented double">However, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.</p><p class="indented double">Well, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.</p><p class="indented double">She spoke, subdued.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?</p><p class="indented double">Even without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.</p><p class="indented double">However, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.</p><p class="indented double">Yet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.</p><p class="indented double">Yet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Even though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash blinked, confused.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">For what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?</p><p class="indented double">Was she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?</p><p class="indented double">Perhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.</p><p class="indented double">Still, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Again, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Applejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.</p><p class="indented double">She wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.</p><p class="indented double">Even so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Pretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.</p><p class="indented double">She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.</p><p class="indented double">Sometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.</p><p class="indented double">But right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.</p><p class="indented double">As the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.</p><p class="indented double">Falling.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 'values': ['//------------------------------//\n// The Ocean Between You and Me// Story: With a Heavy Heart// by Krypqe//------------------------------//\n\n\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wasting my time, Pinkie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tA lot of ponies tell me this.\n\t\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they mean for it to be as mean as it comes across, but the feelings are still there.\n\t\n\tFor a time, I just endured this. Somehow, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt much when said by ponies I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know.\n\t\n\tThen, my friends started saying it.\n\t\n\tIt hurt.\n\t\n\tDid they not trust me?

However, she\xe2\x80\x99d not read a word on the letter for ages, she was staring into it, past the words, to try and find what Pinkie really meant\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tTwilight knew Pinkie, she was her friend. Surely the Pinkie she knew wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tBut Twilight began to wonder, staring into the paper, whether the Pinkie Pie she\xe2\x80\x99d known was Pinkie Pie at all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the not knowing that Pinkie had been hurting that upset Twilight, it was the fact that she had been hurting because of her friends, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed.\n\t\n\tThat, and the friendliest pony she\xe2\x80\x99d ever met; Pinkie Pie, was telling her that \xe2\x80\x98the magic of friendship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as it once appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tFinally, Twilight looked up, from the crumpled, tear smeared words she\xe2\x80\x99d been reading, and upon doing so, realised that she was no longer standing firm like she\xe2\x80\x99d been when she began reading, but collapsed on the floor, curled up in front of Mrs Cake. She could hear Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s heavy breathing from beside her, no doubt caused by Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\t\n\tTwilight sighed, unhappily. It may well have heightened the awkwardness of Sugarcube Corner\xe2\x80\x99s silence, but Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed. Although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific basis behind it, she knew that a sigh could normally alleviate any of her grief.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that this would\xe2\x80\x99ve been true in this situation too, but, her efforts seemed in vain.\n\t\n\tIn fact, to Twilight, it seemed that the thought of a sigh dealing with such important, sensitive things such as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance made the bitter sinking sensation within her a thousand-fold worse.\n\t\n\tTwilight looked across to Mrs Cake, through her slowly clouding eyes, to meet with already cloud-burst ones. Even though the movement of eyes should only take a tiny amount of effort; to Twilight, if felt as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never performed a task more arduous: to meet Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x99s in honesty.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on to Twilight, saying nothing, her forlorn expression speaking in place of words, tears dropping down in place of tone.\n\t\n\tTwilight rifled through her own brain, searching for the perfect words to say \xe2\x80\x93 How do you avoid upsetting somepony in this situation?\n\t\n\tUnable to think, Twilight looked away from Mrs Cake, to Applejack, for support. Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUpon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUnable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tOnce again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAlthough it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.\n\t\n\tEven if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tAll Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tGulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake sighed, again.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\t\n\tTwilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.\n\t\n\tFor the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight shook her head, smiling happily.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tJust before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\tApplejack jumped, gasping suddenly.\n\t\n\tEven though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.\n\t\n\tApplejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?\n\t\n\tAs she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.\n\t\n\tLooking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tNot wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.\n\t\n\tAs the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.\n\t\n\tHowever, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?\n\t\n\tApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.\n\t\n\tFluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.\n\t\n\tRegaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.\n\t\n\tAbsentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.\n\t\n\tApplejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIn truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.\n\t\n\tDespite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.\n\t\n\tHowever, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.\n\t\n\tIt was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.\n\t\n\tWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?\n\t\n\tBut, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.\n\t\n\tThe way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.\n\t\n\tCold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.\n\t\n\tSure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.\n\t\n\tUntil now, that was true.\n\t\n\tNow, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.\n\t\n\tShe just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.\n\t\n\tAs Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.\n\t\n\tShe would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.\n\t\n\tWith her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.\n\t\n\tSounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash smiled, sadly.\n\t\n\tShe knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.\n\t\n\tShe had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.\n\t\n\tBut Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.\n\t\n\tShe was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.\n\t\n\tHowever, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.\n\t\n\tWell, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.\n\t\n\tShe spoke, subdued.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?\n\t\n\tEven without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.\n\t\n\tHowever, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.\n\t\n\tYet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.\n\t\n\tYet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.\n\t\n\tSlowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tEven though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash blinked, confused.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tFor what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.\n\t\n\tPinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?\n\t\n\tWas she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?\n\t\n\tPerhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\n\t\n\tStill, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAgain, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tApplejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.\n\t\n\tShe wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.\n\t\n\tEven so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tPretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.\n\t\n\tShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.\n\t\n\tSometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.\n\t\n\tApplejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.\n\t\n\tBut right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.\n\t\n\tAs the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.\n\t\n\tFalling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t', 9, 2302, '<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/></head>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/15/with-a-heavy-heart">With a Heavy Heart</a></h1>\n\t\t<h2>by <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Krypqe">Krypqe</a></h2>\n\n\t\t<hr />\n\n\t\t<a name=\'9\'></a><h3>The Ocean Between You and Me</h3>\n<br /><p class="indented"><i></p><p class="indented">\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wasting my time, Pinkie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">A lot of ponies tell me this.</p><p class="indented double">I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they mean for it to be as mean as it comes across, but the feelings are still there.</p><p class="indented double">For a time, I just endured this.

However, she\xe2\x80\x99d not read a word on the letter for ages, she was staring into it, past the words, to try and find what Pinkie really meant\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">Twilight knew Pinkie, she was her friend. Surely the Pinkie she knew wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">But Twilight began to wonder, staring into the paper, whether the Pinkie Pie she\xe2\x80\x99d known was Pinkie Pie at all\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the not knowing that Pinkie had been hurting that upset Twilight, it was the fact that she had been hurting because of her friends, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed.</p><p class="indented double">That, and the friendliest pony she\xe2\x80\x99d ever met; Pinkie Pie, was telling her that \xe2\x80\x98the magic of friendship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as it once appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="indented double">Finally, Twilight looked up, from the crumpled, tear smeared words she\xe2\x80\x99d been reading, and upon doing so, realised that she was no longer standing firm like she\xe2\x80\x99d been when she began reading, but collapsed on the floor, curled up in front of Mrs Cake. She could hear Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s heavy breathing from beside her, no doubt caused by Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight sighed, unhappily. It may well have heightened the awkwardness of Sugarcube Corner\xe2\x80\x99s silence, but Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed. Although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific basis behind it, she knew that a sigh could normally alleviate any of her grief.</p><p class="indented double">She\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that this would\xe2\x80\x99ve been true in this situation too, but, her efforts seemed in vain.</p><p class="indented double">In fact, to Twilight, it seemed that the thought of a sigh dealing with such important, sensitive things such as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance made the bitter sinking sensation within her a thousand-fold worse.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked across to Mrs Cake, through her slowly clouding eyes, to meet with already cloud-burst ones. Even though the movement of eyes should only take a tiny amount of effort; to Twilight, if felt as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never performed a task more arduous: to meet Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x99s in honesty.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake looked on to Twilight, saying nothing, her forlorn expression speaking in place of words, tears dropping down in place of tone.</p><p class="indented double">Twilight rifled through her own brain, searching for the perfect words to say \xe2\x80\x93 How do you avoid upsetting somepony in this situation?</p><p class="indented double">Unable to think, Twilight looked away from Mrs Cake, to Applejack, for support. Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Upon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Unable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Once again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Although it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.</p><p class="indented double">Even if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.</p><p class="indented double">She\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">All Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">Gulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Mrs Cake sighed, again.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c</p><p class="indented double">Twilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.</p><p class="indented double">For the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Twilight shook her head, smiling happily.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Just before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">*****</p><p class="indented double">Applejack jumped, gasping suddenly.</p><p class="indented double">Even though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?</p><p class="indented double">As she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.</p><p class="indented double">Looking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Not wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.</p><p class="indented double">As the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.</p><p class="indented double">However, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?</p><p class="indented double">Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.</p><p class="indented double">Fluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Regaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.</p><p class="indented double">Absentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">In truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.</p><p class="indented double">Despite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.</p><p class="indented double">However, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.</p><p class="indented double">It was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.</p><p class="indented double">Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?</p><p class="indented double">But, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">The way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.</p><p class="indented double">Cold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.</p><p class="indented double">Sure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.</p><p class="indented double">Until now, that was true.</p><p class="indented double">Now, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.</p><p class="indented double">She just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.</p><p class="indented double">As Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.</p><p class="indented double">She would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.</p><p class="indented double">With her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.</p><p class="indented double">Sounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Rainbow Dash smiled, sadly.</p><p class="indented double">She knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.</p><p class="indented double">She had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.</p><p class="indented double">But Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.</p><p class="indented double">She was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.</p><p class="indented double">However, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.</p><p class="indented double">Well, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.</p><p class="indented double">She spoke, subdued.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">As embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?</p><p class="indented double">Even without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.</p><p class="indented double">However, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.</p><p class="indented double">Yet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.</p><p class="indented double">Yet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.</p><p class="indented double">Slowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Even though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Applejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash blinked, confused.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">For what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.</p><p class="indented double">Pinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?</p><p class="indented double">Was she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?</p><p class="indented double">Perhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.</p><p class="indented double">Still, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p class="indented double">After all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Again, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.</p><p class="indented double">Rainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">*****</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented">Applejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.</p><p class="indented double">She wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.</p><p class="indented double">Even so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.</p><p class="indented double">\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p class="indented double">Pretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.</p><p class="indented double">She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.</p><p class="indented double">Sometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.</p><p class="indented double">Applejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.</p><p class="indented double">But right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.</p><p class="indented double">As the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.</p><p class="indented double">Falling.</p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></p><p class="indented double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>\t</body>\n</html>', 1, 15], 'parent_story_id': 15, 'txt': '//------------------------------//\n// The Ocean Between You and Me// Story: With a Heavy Heart// by Krypqe//------------------------------//\n\n\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wasting my time, Pinkie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tA lot of ponies tell me this.\n\t\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they mean for it to be as mean as it comes across, but the feelings are still there.\n\t\n\tFor a time, I just endured this.

However, she\xe2\x80\x99d not read a word on the letter for ages, she was staring into it, past the words, to try and find what Pinkie really meant\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tTwilight knew Pinkie, she was her friend. Surely the Pinkie she knew wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tBut Twilight began to wonder, staring into the paper, whether the Pinkie Pie she\xe2\x80\x99d known was Pinkie Pie at all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the not knowing that Pinkie had been hurting that upset Twilight, it was the fact that she had been hurting because of her friends, and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even noticed.\n\t\n\tThat, and the friendliest pony she\xe2\x80\x99d ever met; Pinkie Pie, was telling her that \xe2\x80\x98the magic of friendship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as it once appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tFinally, Twilight looked up, from the crumpled, tear smeared words she\xe2\x80\x99d been reading, and upon doing so, realised that she was no longer standing firm like she\xe2\x80\x99d been when she began reading, but collapsed on the floor, curled up in front of Mrs Cake. She could hear Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s heavy breathing from beside her, no doubt caused by Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\t\n\tTwilight sighed, unhappily. It may well have heightened the awkwardness of Sugarcube Corner\xe2\x80\x99s silence, but Twilight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really fussed. Although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the scientific basis behind it, she knew that a sigh could normally alleviate any of her grief.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that this would\xe2\x80\x99ve been true in this situation too, but, her efforts seemed in vain.\n\t\n\tIn fact, to Twilight, it seemed that the thought of a sigh dealing with such important, sensitive things such as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance made the bitter sinking sensation within her a thousand-fold worse.\n\t\n\tTwilight looked across to Mrs Cake, through her slowly clouding eyes, to meet with already cloud-burst ones. Even though the movement of eyes should only take a tiny amount of effort; to Twilight, if felt as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never performed a task more arduous: to meet Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x99s in honesty.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on to Twilight, saying nothing, her forlorn expression speaking in place of words, tears dropping down in place of tone.\n\t\n\tTwilight rifled through her own brain, searching for the perfect words to say \xe2\x80\x93 How do you avoid upsetting somepony in this situation?\n\t\n\tUnable to think, Twilight looked away from Mrs Cake, to Applejack, for support. Yet, even the dependable, honest pony Applejack was was unable to reassure Twilight; her eyes were glazed over, fazed out, staring at the floor. Joining Applejack, regaining her gaze down at the floor, Twilight resigned herself to the fact that in the time she needed to, she\xe2\x80\x99d never be able to truly find words that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, and so, Twilight decided to speak her mind. Raw, yet still tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise Pinkie Pie felt this way\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight gulped, she knew what she was saying was probably incredibly clich\xc3\xa9, and far from eloquent. Holding back tears, Twilight continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she did, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight still looked to the floor, somewhat guiltily, away from Mrs Cake. Even so, she still heard her sigh, tinged with sadness, but overwhelmed with what sounded like disappointment\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cPinkie always told me you were the clever one, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUpon mention of her name, Twilight looked back up, reflexively, towards Mrs Cake. She was no longer tear stricken, but her eyes were dulled, her snout pulled back, ever so slightly, in a look of disappointment. Perhaps even anger.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to seriously doubt what she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight answered in silence, fearing that what she\xe2\x80\x99d said had worsened the situation.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really were smart, Twilight, you\xe2\x80\x99d have noticed that Pinkie Pie really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99 for a long while now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tUnable to find speech once again, Twilight was relieved to be rescued by a choice few words of Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s southern drawl, even if they did sound slightly wavering.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs Cake, Pinkie was happy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tOnce again, Mrs Cake sighed, remorsefully.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight and Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s confused expressions must have made their thoughts clear to Cup Cake, as she continued on, explaining further.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, and everypony around her, Pinkie Pie was the \xe2\x80\x98happy pony,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she? This was good, for Pinkie. She could spend her days spreading the happiness she loved to surround herself, and then when she had an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 day, she felt no guilt in taking time away, to rest. She felt no guilt in being unhappy, when she had to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake looked on, seemingly nostalgic, to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions, towards the window, into the distance.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, after the Summer Sun Celebration, after she gained the element of Laughter, after she met you, Twilight, she started feeling guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s stomach sank, further than it\xe2\x80\x99d already sunk, with the horrible realisation of what was going to come next.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAfter she had her element bestowed to her, spreading laugher and happiness were no longer just an enjoyment. To Pinkie, she felt that it was her duty to do so. This was fine, for a time, but then I realised that she was having less and less unhappy days. To begin with, I thought this was good, I thought she was just becoming an even happier pony than she already was. It was when the off days became so scarce that they petered away into nothing; that I started to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic look had left her face, once again to be replaced by the grief stricken look she\xe2\x80\x99d worn earlier, tears once more tumbling to the ground, sobs beginning to punctuate her speech.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I confronted her, Pinkie said that I should stop being so silly. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question what her element bestowed upon her. If she could\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve said so. After all, Twilight was not only one of the smartest ponies in Ponyville, but one of her very best friends\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAlthough it may not have been so, but to Twilight, it seemed as though within her upset, Mrs Cake had delivered the last few words with venom.\n\t\n\tEven if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say her words like that, they still took their toll on Twilight, seeping deep into her, as she realised how devastating her negligence had been to Pinkie.\n\t\n\tShe\xe2\x80\x99d been suffering, yet she was too worried to tell anypony.\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie, the party loving pink pony, the spirit of the element of laughter, wanted anything but to bring about unhappiness\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tAll Twilight would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do was say a few words, and then Pinkie Pie would never have gone\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tGulping down, forgetting the delicacy of the situation and remembering the urgency, Twilight began to speak quickly, her organisational skills coming into play.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we need to find Pinkie Pie. Before she does anything\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Twilight paused for a moment, searching for the right word. \xe2\x80\x9cSilly\xe2\x80\xa6 Where would she go when she was feeling \xe2\x80\x98off?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tMrs Cake sighed, again.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight, if you really were Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\xe2\x80\x99d-\xe2\x80\x9c\n\t\n\tTwilight butted in, still headstrong from her sense of urgency.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to, we can discuss to what lengths my friendship with Pinkie extends to, but right now, if you really cared, you\xe2\x80\x99d help me find her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight looked dead into Mrs Cake\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unwavering.\n\t\n\tFor the first time in a while, Sugarcube Corner felt a bit happier, warmed by the faintest of smiles. Even if Cup Cake was still looking down to the floor, tears still seeping out, it was still there.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cOn the days when Pinkie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so \xe2\x80\x98Pinkie,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to climb the mountain trail above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d Cup Cake\xe2\x80\x99s smile tinged with sadness again, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left completely, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight began to pour concentration into her horn, focusing on Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location, yet she still had concentration for a few choice words.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAll I did was tell you where she was, Twilight Sparkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tTwilight shook her head, smiling happily.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you for believing in the magic of friendship again\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tJust before Twilight blinked away, she caught the glimpse of one of the happiest, teary eyed faces she\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\tApplejack jumped, gasping suddenly.\n\t\n\tEven though she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten mostly used to Twilight\xe2\x80\x99s magic, whenever she disappeared like that, well, it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural.\n\t\n\tApplejack turned away from Mrs Cake, slowly trotting towards the door, but feeling guilt with every hoofstep. How could they just not notice Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness?\n\t\n\tAs she reached the doorway, Applejack faltered, hoof waiting in the air to push at the door. As much as she wanted to just leave the resonating tension of Sugarcube Corner, she knew that she ought to say something before she did so, just to try and patch things up.\n\t\n\tLooking over her shoulder, glancing towards Mrs Cake, Applejack spoke, huskily, tentatively.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Cake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find Pinkie Pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack tried desperately to convey her voice in its normal, reassuring affirmative manner, but it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. In the end, she settled once again for tentative huskiness.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re her friends, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tNot wanting to let the melancholy linger, and wanting to leave on an optimistic note, Applejack finally outstretched her forehoof, nudging the door forward, emptying her lungs of the bitterly sickly sweet air, and breathing deeply, replacing it with the cold fresh air of outside.\n\t\n\tAs the door behind her slammed shut, sending a light breeze through Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s Stetson topped mane, she began to slowly trot, absentmindedly, deep within thought, in no particular direction.\n\t\n\tHowever, Applejack knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in particular; it was a conscious decision to just wander around, as what was a pony supposed to do on receiving such news?\n\t\n\tApplejack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth moved to form an \xe2\x80\x98o,\xe2\x80\x99 as she realised what she had to do, and where she had to go. She had to let Pinkie Pie\xe2\x80\x99s other friends know what was happening.\n\t\n\tFluttershy and Rarity were away, far out of town, which left Applejack with one main choice. She had to go and see Rainbow Dash.\n\t\n\tRegaining control over her hooves\xe2\x80\x99 direction, Applejack pointed herself at the floating mass of clouds and rainbows at the edge of Ponyville, and trotted on.\n\t\n\tAbsentmindedly staring at Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, trudging onwards, Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s mind became overcome with worry, not just as Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s words sank in, more and more so, but also over the prospect of meeting Dash. Not because of the relationship between them, Applejack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stupid pony, she knew there were more important things to confront than the growing distance between them, but even so, Applejack couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let constant worries about what Dash was actually thinking about her.\n\t\n\tApplejack knew that Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the most emotionally mature pony, and so, she knew that Dash would probably react somewhat badly to Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Load that on top of how Dash was reacting over the relationship between herself and Applejack, and well\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\tIn truth, not even Applejack, the pony who was pretty much closest to Dash, the pony who\xe2\x80\x99d stayed up on stormy nights, listening to Dash, listening to her every thought, could know how she would react.\n\t\n\tDespite her not knowing, Applejack liked that about their relationship, the idea that Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything from her, she trusted in Applejack enough to confide in her all of her secrets, however, she still felt the need to tell Applejack all the little things too. The tiny, inconsequential things that amount to nothing. No thought was deemed too small, nor too pointless to tell her.\n\t\n\tHowever, despite Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she could be there for Dash, and to listen to her, this was also, unfortunately one of the things that made Applejack begin to question the relationship between them.\n\t\n\tIt was the way Dash told her these things. Always in secret, during nights, reminiscent of their first night spent together.\n\t\n\tWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they meet during the day? What was wrong with meeting how ponies in a relationship normally would?\n\t\n\tBut, the meeting places weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only problem for Applejack.\n\t\n\tThe way these thoughts were told to her; they felt cold.\n\t\n\tCold, passed on thoughtlessly, dumped onto Applejack. Not once had Dash ever asked if Applejack was okay, or if there was anything she wanted to talk about.\n\t\n\tSure, Applejack knew Dash was loyal. She was the most loyal pony Applejack had ever known. She would always come to see Applejack, if she called for her, without hesitation, and despite Dash\xe2\x80\x99s lack of asking after Applejack, would always tell her that she loved her.\n\t\n\tUntil now, that was true.\n\t\n\tNow, Applejack felt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty wavering, unhinging with her far from mature emotions.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty one bit, however.\n\t\n\tShe just suspected that Dash\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty was beginning to shift to somepony else.\n\t\n\tAs Applejack reached the base of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-house, she scuffed the ground with her hooves, kicking up dust, trying to delay what she knew was going to be a difficult conversation.\n\t\n\tShe would\xe2\x80\x99ve liked to think otherwise, but with the element of honesty within her, Applejack found it hard to even lie to herself.\n\t\n\tWith her still wavering southern accent, Applejack began to call out\xe2\x80\xa6\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, I need to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs much as she\xe2\x80\x99d been building it up to look bad, Applejack was still very much looking forward to speaking with Dash.\n\t\n\tSounding more eager than stern, Applejack yelled, loudly.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDash, haul yer flank out here RIGHT NOW!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash smiled, sadly.\n\t\n\tShe knew Applejack was going to turn up at her house, sooner rather than later, but even so; she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything that she could say which would help her out of her predicament.\n\t\n\tShe had contemplated flying off. To fly off and not talk to Applejack at all.\n\t\n\tBut Rainbow Dash wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid. She may have been stupid enough to drop herself into the mess she\xe2\x80\x99d gotten herself into, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to abandon all of her friends over something like this.\n\t\n\tShe was the spirit of the element of loyalty, after all.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash trotted towards her door, and, in the presence of Applejack, the only pony who could really make her feel uneasy; sheepishly poked her head out, nervously grinning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Applejack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash sighed; she could see the look on Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s face, her serious, determined look, and with that, she knew that it was pointless to resist Applejack. Of course, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from trying.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI said git down here now, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash still stayed behind her door, head poking out.\n\t\n\tHowever, instead of dancing about the issue, she decided to come out and just be truthful; she felt as if too many lies had passed between the two of them.\n\t\n\tWell, Rainbow Dash wanted to think that they were between the two of them, but really, they were just her own lies.\n\t\n\tShe spoke, subdued.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ready for this talk yet, Applejack\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAs embarrassed as Rainbow Dash was about actually admitting such a thing, she still looked down to Applejack, continuing to meet her gaze. It was as if they were together on one of their nights; she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Applejack being there, and knowing more than Rainbow Dash might ever let on to just anypony.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cQuite rightly, Sugarcube, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m all that ready for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk mahself, either\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s voice was no longer as harsh. It\xe2\x80\x99d calmed, somewhat, softened. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash was used to, on cold, dark nights. This was the voice that Rainbow Dash especially loved. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash arched an eyebrow, questioning.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh need to talk to you about something else, Dash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash was still somewhat confused, what could Applejack want to talk about that was more important than their relations?\n\t\n\tEven without her somewhat egotistical tendencies, Rainbow Dash struggled to see what could possibly need to be more imminently addressed than that.\n\t\n\tHowever, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain; it gave her more time to think of what she could actually say to Applejack that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin everything.\n\t\n\tYet, the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only reason that Rainbow Dash was stalling. It was also that she\xe2\x80\x99d never really stopped to think about what she was going to say before.\n\t\n\tYet now? It seemed like she was doing so all the time; especially with Applejack.\n\t\n\tSlowly, spreading her wings, Rainbow Dash descended from her cloud-house, not flying down, but floating down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash touched down in front of Applejack, face to face, trying to still seem confident by still meeting her eyes.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAh ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna beat around the bush, Dash. This is something you need to know, sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tEven though Rainbow Dash knew that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about the relationship between the two of them, she still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but let her mind run away, applying everything Applejack was saying to the two of them, regardless.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash heard Applejack inhale, loudly, and then begin to speak, in a pained, upset tone.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pinkie Pie; she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tApplejack silenced for a moment, her look turning thoughtful.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash blinked, confused.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tFor what felt like the thousandth time in the day, Rainbow Dash didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know what to say.\n\t\n\tPinkie Pie, gone? Why would she leave? Why would she leave without saying goodbye?\n\t\n\tWas she not important enough to Pinkie Pie to at least tell her she was going?\n\t\n\tPerhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone, Rainbow Dash supposed, but she\xe2\x80\x99d merely gone away, for a day or two. That was what she wanted to believe. However, from the look she\xe2\x80\x99d got from Applejack; the concerned, serious, matter-of-fact look, Rainbow Dash was sure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\n\t\n\tStill, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Rainbow Dash from hoping. Hoping that Pinkie Pie had, in fact, gone away, on an unplanned holiday, just for fun; anything but just \xe2\x80\x98gone.\xe2\x80\x99\n\t\n\tAfter all, Pinkie Pie did unplanned things like that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tAgain, Rainbow Dash heard Applejack sigh, unhappily, whilst scuffing her hooves against the ground, looking down.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash felt her insides turn over, her worst fears seemingly confirmed.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x99s gone to look for her, where Mrs Cake thought she could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash suddenly felt a tiny bit better, her ears pricking up at Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s words of possible redemption.\n\t\n\tRainbow Dash began to speak quickly, suddenly eager.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where did Twilight go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\t\n\t*****\n\t\n\t\n\tApplejack turned around, looking towards the mountain beyond Ponyville, away from Dash.\n\t\n\tShe wanted to draw out this moment, even if it was just for a few seconds more, because, Applejack knew, as soon as she told Dash where Pinkie\xe2\x80\x99s supposed location was, she\xe2\x80\x99d be gone.\n\t\n\tApplejack didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for this; she knew that Dash was loyal, and that even the few seconds Applejack was keeping her from Pinkie were probably tearing her apart.\n\t\n\tEven so, Applejack still wanted Dash close to her; after all, she was hurting too.\n\t\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the mountain trail, the one above Ponyville.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\n\tPretty much as soon as the final word had left Applejack\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; she heard the predictable sound of wings flapping, frantically, quickly, and then, as Dash shot past her, she felt wind shoot along with her, washing through her hair. Her Stetson trembled in the wind, unsteady.\n\t\n\tShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fault Dash for having wings, after all, without them; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the Dash that Applejack knew.\n\t\n\tSometimes, she just wished Dash would slow down a bit, to wait. Perhaps even to think.\n\t\n\tApplejack sighed, sadly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t normally mind being left behind by her friends; she was proud to be an earth pony.\n\t\n\tBut right now, there was nothing more that Applejack wanted then to be up to speed, with them.\n\t\n\tAs the final gust formed by Dash\xe2\x80\x99s flight whipped past Applejack, it loosened the Stetson\xe2\x80\x99s trembling perch, stealing it away, flying gracefully in the wind, sweeping down to the ground.\n\t\n\tFalling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t', 'epub': None}
